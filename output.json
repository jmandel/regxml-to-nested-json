      "<P>\n                        The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated responsibilities to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) for the implementation of certain provisions in Title IV of the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255, Dec. 13, 2016) (Cures Act) that are designed to: advance interoperability; support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information (EHI); and identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking.\n                        <SU>1</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         ONC is responsible for implementation of certain provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (Pub. L. 111-5, Feb. 17. 2009) (HITECH Act) including: requirements that the National Coordinator perform duties consistent with the development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information and that promotes a more effective marketplace, greater competition, and increased consumer choice, among other goals; and requirements to keep or recognize a program or programs for the voluntary certification of health information technology. This proposed rule seeks to fulfill statutory requirements; provide transparency; advance equity, innovation, and interoperability; and support the access to, and exchange and use of, EHI. Transparency regarding healthcare information and activities—as well as the interoperability and electronic exchange of health information—are all in the best interest of the patient and are central to the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>In addition to addressing the HITECH Act's and Cures Act's requirements described above and advancing interoperability, the proposed rule aligns with and supports Executive Orders (E.O.) 13994, 13985, 14036, and 14058. The President issued E.O. 13994 on January 21, 2021, to ensure a data-driven response to COVID-19 and future high-consequence public health threats. The Cures Act and the information blocking provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program (85 FR 25642) (ONC Cures Act Final Rule) have enabled critical steps to making data available across the healthcare system. The proposed rule proposes to adopt certification criteria to advance interoperability and support public health reporting and exchange. Because we recognize the need for greater interoperability of public health technology and access to more actionable data by public health authorities (PHA) and their partners, the proposed rule lays out a multi-pronged approach that takes advantage of, and builds upon, the various previous efforts to advance public health reporting, including advancements in HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-based (FHIR®) solutions and evolving standards related to public health interoperability. We have proposed this approach to allow for systems to mature and advance in an aligned fashion, reduce the need for manual workarounds and intervention, and lead to wider adoption of advanced standards-based capabilities.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The proposed adoption of the United States Core Data for Interoperability Standard Version 4 (USCDI v4) would promote the establishment and use of interoperable data sets of EHI for interoperable health data exchange. As discussed in section III.B.1, USCDI v4 would facilitate the collection, access and exchange of data for use in public health and emergency response (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         the COVID-19 pandemic) by capturing and promoting the sharing of key data elements related to public health. The proposal to adopt a new certification criterion for standardized FHIR-based application programming interfaces (APIs) for public health reporting, as discussed in section III.B.13.f, reflects ONC's continued efforts to develop and standardize APIs and facilitate exchange of public health data between health care providers and public health agencies, to securely access EHI through the broader adoption of standardized APIs.\n                        <SU>2</SU>\n                         \n                        <SU>3</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                        As discussed in section III.B, adopting USCDI v4 and the proposals in § 170.315(g)(20) are intended to facilitate core public health missions including detecting and monitoring, investigating and responding, informing and disseminating, and being response-ready.

      "<P>\n                        We are committed to advancing health equity, and this proposed rule is consistent with E.O. 13985 of January 20, 2021, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\n                        <SU>4</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Section 1 of E.O. 13985 states that “the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.” Section 1 of E.O. 13985 also states that because “advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies must recognize and work to redress inequities in any policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity.” We believe USCDI v4 and proposals in § 170.315(f) and § 170.315(g)(20) would not only support identifying and responding to public health threats, but also support advancing equity. As noted above, we propose to modify current certification \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63501\"/>\n                        criteria in § 170.315(f) and adopt new criteria in § 170.315(f) for Health IT Modules supporting public health data exchange that would help increase the data shared between health care providers, laboratories, and PHAs, and would increase interoperability among the different systems in place at each entity. Our proposed changes focus on providing more complete patient-level information for contact tracing and further case investigation, patient outreach, direct care, and other clinical and public health activities. For example, some of the proposed standards would require the exchange of available patient demographic information, including race, ethnicity, sex, and contact information; and may allow PHAs to get more complete data when providers and laboratories have these data elements and can appropriately fill the fields. Additionally, if finalized as proposed, the adoption of USCDI v4 would update the USCDI standard to include new data elements under the Health Status Assessments, Medications, Allergies and Intolerances, Goals and Preferences, Encounter Information, Vital Signs, and Laboratory data classes, and a new data class, Facility Information, as discussed in section III.B.1 of this proposed rule. Expanding the data elements included in USCDI would increase the amount and type of data available to be used and exchanged through certified health IT. Our proposed standards update for public health and USCDI v4 could help capture more accurate and complete patient characteristics that are reflective of patient diversity and could potentially help data users address disparities in health outcomes for all patients, including those who may be marginalized and underrepresented. This could also support data users' abilities to identify, assess, and analyze gaps in care, which could in turn be used to inform and address the quality of healthcare through interventions and strategies. This could lead to better patient care, experiences, and health outcomes.\n                    </P>",

As described throughout the proposed rule, competition would be advanced through these improved API standards that can help individuals connect to their information and can help health care providers involved in the patient's care to securely access information. For example, these standards are designed to foster an ecosystem of new applications that can connect through the API technology to provide patients with improved electronic access to EHI and more choices in their health care providers.

      "<P>\n                        Further, as described in section IV of this proposed rule, we propose enhancements to support information sharing under the information blocking regulations and promote innovation and competition, while ensuring patients' privacy and access to care remain protected. As we have noted, addressing information blocking is critical for promoting innovation and competition in health IT and for the delivery of healthcare services to individuals, as discussed in both the ONC Cures Act Proposed (84 FR 7508) and Final (85 FR 25790 through 25791) Rules, and reiterated in the Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing (HTI-1) Final Rule (89 FR 1192). Specifically, we described how the information blocking provisions provide a comprehensive response to the issues identified by empirical and economic research that suggested that information blocking may weaken competition, encourage consolidation, and create barriers to entry for developers of new and innovative applications and technologies that enable more effective uses of EHI to improve population health and the patient experience.\n                        <SU>7</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         We explained that the information blocking provision of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) itself expressly addresses practices that impede innovation and advancements in EHI access, exchange, and use, including care delivery enabled by health IT (89 FR 1195, citing section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA). Actors subject to the information blocking provisions may, among other practices, attempt to exploit their control over interoperability elements to create barriers to entry for competing technologies and services that offer greater value for health IT customers and users, provide new or improved capabilities, and enable more robust access, exchange, and use of EHI (85 FR 25820).\n                        <SU>8</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Information blocking may also harm competition not just in health IT markets, but also in markets for healthcare services (85 FR 25820). In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we described practices that dominant market providers may leverage and use to control access and use of their technology, resulting in technical dependence and possibly leading to barriers to entry by would-be competitors, as well as making some market providers vulnerable to acquisition or inducement into arrangements that enhance the market power of incumbent providers to the detriment of consumers and purchasers \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63502\"/>\n                        of healthcare services (85 FR 25820). The implementation of the new information blocking provisions proposed and discussed in section IV of this proposed rule would continue to promote innovation and support the lawful access, exchange, and use of EHI, while strengthening support for individuals' privacy and EHI sharing preferences.\n                    </P>",

CMS also finalized electronic prior authorization measures for eligible clinicians who participate in the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the MIPS; and eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals that participate in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program, beginning in the CY 2027 performance period and the EHR reporting period in CY 2027, respectively (89 FR 8760). In this proposed rule, we propose to adopt standards and establish certification criteria to facilitate electronic prior authorization using certified health IT, which providers can use to complete the required actions under the finalized measures. Lastly, we are committed to our continued, collaborative work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on improving public health data systems. The proposed updates to the ONC Health IT Certification Program's public health criteria and complementary public health criteria for PHA systems would support CDC's Data Modernization Initiative and Public Health Data Strategy.\n                        <SU>11</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         We believe these approaches would increase efficiency for delivery of services and programs, reduce confusion for participants in these programs, and better serve the public interest.\n                    </P>",

For example, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) prohibits recipients of Federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of disability by excluding people with disabilities from participation in, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination in their programs or activities. 29 U.S.C. 794. Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Section 1557) prohibits certain health programs and activities, including those receiving Federal financial assistance from HHS, from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability by excluding them from participation in, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination in their health programs or activities. 42 U.S.C. 18116(a). Newly issued Section 504 regulations require recipients to ensure that web content and mobile apps that a recipient provides or makes available, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, with some exceptions. \n                        <E T=\"03\">See</E>\n                         89 FR 40066 and 45 CFR Secs. 84.82-.89(a).

Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of places of public accommodation. 42 U.S.C. 12182. Title II of the ADA prohibits state and local government \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63503\"/>\n                        entities from discriminating on the basis of disability by excluding people with disabilities from participation in, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination in their services, programs, or activities. 42 U.S.C. 12132. On April 24, 2024, the Department of Justice published regulations establishing specific requirements, including the adoption of specific technical standards, for making accessible the services, programs, and activities offered by State and local government entities through the web and mobile applications. 89 FR 31320. More generally, these statutes and their implementing regulations apply to programs, services and activities implemented through or with information and communications technology (ICT). In addition, the Section 1557 implementing regulation addresses ICT specifically, providing that covered entities, including health programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance from HHS, shall ensure that their health programs or activities provided through ICT are accessible to individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would result in undue financial and administrative burdens or a fundamental alteration in the nature of the health programs or activities. 89 FR 37522 (May 6, 2024) (45 CFR 92.204).\n                    </P>"

Considering the need for greater interoperability of public health technology and access to more actionable data by PHAs and their partners,\n                        <SU>13</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         as discussed in section III.B.13, we propose: to revise the Program's current certification criteria related to public health in § 170.315(f), including referencing newer versions of respective exchange and vocabulary standards in the current § 170.315(f) certification criteria (§ 170.315(f)(1)-(f)(7)); proposing two additional certification criteria for birth reporting (§ 170.315(f)(8)) and bi-directional exchange with a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) (§ 170.315(f)(9)); proposing new certification criteria for Health IT Modules supporting public health data exchange in § 170.315(f)(21)-(25), (28) and (29); and, proposing a new certification criterion for a standardized FHIR®-based API for public health data exchange in § 170.315(g)(20). The new certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(20) would support ongoing and future development of public health FHIR IGs leveraging a core set of existing, modular, and extensible capabilities and standards. The standards referenced in the proposed § 170.315(g)(20) certification criterion support FHIR capabilities such as API-based event notifications (\n                        <E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>\n                         FHIR Subscriptions), SMART App Launch, Bulk Data Export, and requirements for authorization and authentication, drawing on the Program's requirements for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10).\n                    </P>",

      "<P>\n                        In this rule, we propose revisions to defined terms for purposes of the information blocking regulations, which appear in 45 CFR 171.102. We propose to revise three existing exceptions in subpart B of 45 CFR part 171 and solicit comment on potential revisions to one exception in subpart D. We propose two new exceptions, one in each in subparts B and C of part 171. We propose to codify in § 171.401 definitions of certain terms relevant to the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                         (TEFCA\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                        ) and in § 171.104 descriptions of certain practices that constitute interference with the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information (EHI).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>As discussed in section IV.A.1, we propose to amend the definition of “health care provider,” codified in 45 CFR 171.10,2 so that it is explicitly clear that it references 42 U.S.C. 300jj(3) and that for purposes of this definition the terms “laboratory” and “pharmacist” have the meanings established for these terms in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(10) and (12), respectively. In IV.A.2, we propose that for purposes of the information blocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171 both “health information technology” and its shorter form, “health IT,” have the same meaning as “health information technology” in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5).</P>",
      "<P>For purposes of the information blocking definition (§ 171.103), the term “interfere with or interference” is currently defined in § 171.102. Informed by the concerns and questions that interested parties have brought to our attention, we propose in section IV.A.3 to add a section (§ 171.104) to the information blocking regulations that would codify certain practices (acts and omissions) that constitute interferences for purposes of the information blocking definition (codified in § 171.103). The proposed codified practices are not an exhaustive list; additional practices not described in the proposed § 171.104 that are likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI may also be considered to rise to the level of an interference. The proposed codification of these specific practices is intended to provide actors, and those who seek to engage in EHI access, exchange, or use with actors, certainty that these specific practices constitute interference. The codification of these practices may also help regulated entities and other interested parties to consider the likelihood that any practice an actor might contemplate or engage in may also meet the definition of “interference” and “interfere with” (as defined in § 171.102) for purposes of the information blocking regulations (45 CFR part 171).</P>",
      "<P>For purposes of the information blocking Privacy Exception, the term “individual” is defined in § 171.202(a)(2). As currently worded, this text includes cross-references to incorrect citations within § 171.202(a)(2). The text also includes one unnecessary cross-reference citation within § 171.202(a)(2). We do not propose to change the substance of the definition, but in section IV.B.1.a, we propose technical corrections to the cross-reference citations within § 171.202(a)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v).</P>",
      "<P>In section IV.B.1.b, to clearly establish coverage of the § 171.202(d) sub-exception for all actors' practices under the same requirements, we propose to change the name of the sub-exception to: “interfering with individual access based on unreviewable grounds.” This proposed change to the header text is intended to express the expansion of its availability to actors who are not Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) covered entities or business associates (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103). As explained in section IV.B.1.c, we propose to slightly modify the header of § 171.202(e) for ease of reference to “Individual's request not to share EHI.” More importantly, we propose to revise the § 171.202(e) sub-exception to remove the existing limitation that allows the exception to be used only for individual-requested restrictions on EHI sharing that are permitted by other applicable law. The proposal would extend the availability of the § 171.202(e) sub-exception to an actor's practice of applying restrictions the individual has requested on the access, exchange, or use of an individual's EHI even when the actor may have concern that another law applicable to some or all of the actor's operations could compel the actor to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI contrary to the individual's expressed wishes.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose, as discussed in section IV.B.2, revisions to three conditions of the Infeasibility Exception (45 CFR 171.204).

We propose to revise the condition to specifically cross-reference additional information blocking exceptions under which an actor may choose to withhold EHI that the actor could, under applicable law, make available.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose to modify the § 171.204(a)(3) \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition by changing the words “health care provider” to “covered entity as defined in 45 CFR 160.103” in the exclusion from applicability of this condition.

      "<P>\n                        We propose to modify the § 171.204(b) \n                        <E T=\"03\">responding to requests</E>\n                         condition by establishing different timeframes for sending written responses to the requestor based on the § 171.204(a) condition under which fulfilling the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI is infeasible. The proposed revision would retain the requirement that actors communicate to requestors “in writing the reason(s) why the request is infeasible” that we \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63509\"/>\n                        finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule. We discuss these proposals further in sections IV.B.2.a through c of this proposed rule.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In section IV.B.3, we propose a new Protecting Care Access Exception that would, under specified conditions (see sections IV.B.3.b through d and the draft regulatory text of proposed § 171.206), apply to acts or omissions likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of particular EHI that an actor believes could create a risk of exposing patients, care providers, and other persons who assist in access or delivery of health care to potential administrative, civil, or criminal investigations or other actions on certain bases. A summary of these bases follows below in this section. (Please see section IV.B.3 of this proposed rule for detailed discussion.)</P>",
      "<P>The proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) would be a new exception in addition to the other information blocking exceptions. The proposed new exception is designed to create certainty for actors that certain practices for which no other exception would apply will not be considered “information blocking” under the information blocking statute (PHSA section 3022) and regulations (45 CFR part 171). Like any existing or proposed information blocking exception in 45 CFR part 171, the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) is not intended to override any provision of another law that is independently applicable to the actor.</P>",
      "<P>The practices that the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) would except from the information blocking definition would be those implemented based on the actor's good faith belief that sharing EHI indicating that any person(s) sought, received, provided, or facilitated the provision or receipt of reproductive health care that was lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided could result in a risk of potential exposure to legal action for those persons and that the risk could be reduced by practices likely to interfere with particular access, exchange, or use of specific EHI. For purposes of the Protecting Care Access Exception, we propose to rely on the same definition of “reproductive health care” (which can be found in 45 CFR 160.103) that is used for purposes of the HIPAA regulations. In addition, we discuss in section IV.B.3.b how we would interpret whether care is “lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided.”</P>",
      "<P>To satisfy the proposed new Protecting Care Access (§ 171.206) Exception, an actor's practice would need to satisfy the threshold condition (§ 171.206(a)), and at least one of the other two conditions in the exception: the patient protection condition (§ 171.206(b)) or the care access condition (§ 171.206(c)). The combination of conditions required to satisfy the proposed new Protecting Care Access Exception and the definition of “legal action” (in § 171.206(d)) for purposes of the exception would, together, ensure that the exception would not apply to an actor's attempts to shield any person from legal action based on allegations that health care items or services the person provided are substandard.</P>",
      "<P>These provisions together would also ensure that the exception focuses on the specific situation where an actor limits the sharing of EHI because the actor believes it could result in a risk of potentially exposing the patient or another person to an investigation or other civil, criminal, or administrative action based on the mere fact that the person sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated reproductive health care that was lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. For instance, the exception would not apply to an actor's attempt to interfere with EHI sharing in order to reduce a patient's or other person's risk of exposure to a criminal investigation or charges not related to the act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. For example, the act of not sharing information because of the risk of a criminal investigation related to operating a vehicle while intoxicated or committing fraud would not be covered under this exception.</P>",
      "<P>The Protecting Care Access Exception's threshold condition (§ 171.206(a)), proposed in section IV.B.3.b, includes requirements that the practice be: undertaken based on the actor's belief as specified in § 171.206(a)(1), no broader than necessary as specified in § 171.206(a)(2), and be implemented consistent with a written organizational policy or case-by-case determination contemporaneously documented in writing as specified in § 171.206(a)(3). Meeting the threshold condition would be necessary, but not alone sufficient, for an actor's practice to be covered by the proposed Protecting Care Access (§ 171.206) exception. To satisfy the exception, any actor's practice likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI would also need to satisfy at least one of the other two conditions (in paragraphs (b) and (c)) of the proposed exception.</P>",
      "<P>In section IV.B.3.c, we propose a patient protection condition (§ 171.206(b)), that can be met by practices implemented by the actor for the purpose of reducing a risk of potential legal action that the actor believes a patient could otherwise face because the EHI shows or invites a reasonable inference that the patient has or has done any of the following (see proposed § 171.206(b)(1)):</P>",
      "<P>(i) obtained reproductive health care that was lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided;</P>",
      "<P>(ii) Inquired about or expressed an interest in seeking reproductive health care; or</P>",
      "<P>(iii) Particular demographic characteristics or any health condition(s) or history for which reproductive health care is often sought, obtained, or medically indicated.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The proposed patient protection condition would specify (§ 171.206(b)(2)) that to meet the condition the actor's practice must be subject to nullification by explicit request or directive from the patient. We also clarify (in proposed § 171.206(b)(3)) that for purposes of the patient protection condition's other paragraphs that “patient” means the natural person who is the subject of the EHI or another natural person referenced in, or identifiable from, the EHI as having sought or received reproductive health care.\n                        <SU>15</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                    </P>",

The § 160.103 definition of “person” clarifies the meaning of “natural person” within it. We use “natural person” in this proposed rule with that same meaning.\n                        </P>\n                    </FTNT>",
      "<P>In section IV.B.3.d, we propose a care access condition (§ 171.206(c)) that can be met by practices an actor might choose to implement for the purpose of reducing a risk of potential exposure to legal action for licensed health care professionals, other health care providers, or persons involved in providing or in facilitating the provision or receipt of reproductive health care that is lawful under the circumstances in which such health care is provided. We request comment on multiple, potentially non-exclusive, alternative proposals for additional requirements under the care access condition that would function to restrict the exception's coverage of practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use in scenarios that also implicate the HIPAA Privacy Rule's individual right of access provisions (45 CFR 164.524). In order to satisfy this proposed condition, if finalized, the practice would need to meet the requirements finalized in § 171.206(c).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose clarifying provisions in § 171.206(d) (discussed in section \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63510\"/>\n                        IV.B.3.b of this proposed rule) and § 171.206(e) (discussed in section IV.B.3.e of this proposed rule). Proposed § 171.206(d) would clarify when reproductive health care sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated by someone other than the actor will be presumed to have been lawful for purposes of assessing whether an actor's practice meets the exception's patient protection or care access condition. In § 171.206(e) we propose to define “legal action” for purposes of § 171.206. We propose in section IV.B.4, a new information blocking exception: “Requestor Preferences” in 45 CFR 171.304. This exception would stand separate from and independent of other exceptions and would apply where an actor honors or adheres to a requestor's preference(s) expressed or confirmed in writing for: (1) limitations on the amount of EHI made available to the requestor; (2) the conditions under which EHI is made available to the requestor; and (3) when EHI is made available to the requestor for access, exchange, or use. The exception would offer an actor certainty that, so long as the actor's practices meet the conditions of the exception, the actor can honor or adhere to a requestor's preferences related to these specific preferences without concern that the actor may be engaging in “information blocking” as defined in 45 CFR 171.103.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We propose to add a new definitions section in § 171.401 for certain terms used in Subpart D, which we propose to align with the definitions used in the proposed 45 CFR 172. We seek comment on some aspects of the TEFCA Manner Exception in 45 CFR 171.403, including the limitation on its use for requests made via a FHIR API and the application of the Fees and Licensing Exceptions to practices that satisfy the exception.</P>"

Doing so will simplify exchange by significantly reducing the number of connections (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         portals) that individuals, health care providers, and other interested parties need to make to get the health information they seek. It does so by creating baseline governance, legal, and technical requirements that will enable secure information sharing across different networks nationwide, including: a common method for authenticating trusted network participants, a common set of rules for trusted exchange, organizational and operational policies to enable the exchange of health information among networks, and a process for filing and adjudicating noncompliance with the terms of the Common Agreement. As explained in proposed part 172, we believe that TEFCA will help lower the cost and expand the nationwide availability of secure health information exchange capabilities. The availability of TEFCA-based services, such as electronic address directories and patient record location, will also help scale health information exchange nationwide and usher in new support for FHIR API usage and adoption.

The proposed rule proposed to implement certain provisions of the Cures Act that would advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. We also requested comment in the ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule (84 FR 7467) as to whether certain health IT developers should be required to participate in TEFCA as a means of providing assurances to their customers and ONC that they are not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI, with the goal of developing or \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63514\"/>\n                        supporting TEFCA for the purpose of ensuring full network-to-network exchange of health information.\n                    </P>",

The HTI-1 Final Rule also made several updates to certification criteria and standards recognized by the Program. The Program updates included revised certification criteria for “decision support interventions,” “patient demographics and observations,” and “electronic case reporting,” as well as adopted a new baseline version of the USCDI standard, USCDI Version 3. Additionally, the HTI-1 Final Rule provided enhancements to support information sharing under the information blocking regulations.

Public comments received during the HTI-1 rulemaking process indicated near universal support for the adoption of the SMART v2 Guide, with the caveat that several of these commenters suggested we adopt the newest balloted version of the SMART App Launch IG, which at the time of the HTI-1 public comment period was version 2.1. We declined to adopt the newest balloted version of the SMART App Launch IG in the HTI-1 Final Rule, noting that the SMART v2 Guide had “already been an established part of the Program via SVAP and rigorously tested . . .” (89 FR 1292). However, we also noted that “[w]e will consider potential ways the SMART v2.1 IG could be included in the Program in the future . . .” (89 FR 1292).</P>",

Furthermore, we finalized in the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1294) that as part of supporting the SMART App Launch “permission-v2” capability Health IT Modules must support certain sub-resource scopes for the Condition and Observation resources. Specifically, we established minimal conformance requirements at the category level for the Condition and Observation resources using specifications and guidance from the SMART v2 Guide and FHIR US Core 6.1.0 implementation guides to ensure that Health IT Modules required to support the SMART v2 Guide are capable of supporting the finer-grained resource constraints capability without being overly prescriptive in setting expectations for how the Health IT Module implements such capabilities.</P>",
      "<P>In this proposed rule, we clarify the existing Program requirements to support patient authorization using SMART App Launch capabilities. Specifically, we clarify that if both the “permission-patient” and “permission-v2” capabilities are required in support of patient authorization for certification to a criterion in the Program, then a Health IT Module must support the following:</P>",

We propose “Permissions” in § 170.315(j)(9), which is cross-referenced in § 170.315(g)(10) and § 170.315(g)(30) in this proposed rule. We anticipate that future certification criteria will also include “permission-patient” and “permission-v2” support requirements to support of patient authorization and we intend for this clarification to support patient authorization of individual sub-resource level scopes to also apply.\n                    </P>",

Additionally, to eliminate ambiguity in URL resolution, the SMART v2.2 Guide mandates the use of absolute URLs in the Well-Known configuration file, disallowing relative URLs. The SMART v2.2 Guide also introduces a new Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) security requirement applicable to servers supporting purely browser-based apps. Finally, an important new addition to the SMART v2.2 Guide is the User-Access Brands and Endpoints (Brands) specification, which allows API providers to publish Brands associated with their FHIR Endpoints to enable apps to collect and present these Brands to users (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         patients).\n                    </P>",

      "<P>Based on HTI-1 public comment feedback and to make use of the new Brands specification in the Program, we propose to adopt the SMART v2.2 Guide in § 170.215(c)(3) and incorporate it by reference as a subparagraph in § 170.299. Additionally, we propose that the adoption of the SMART v2 Guide in § 170.215(c)(2) would expire on January 1, 2028. If we finalize these proposals, developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to criteria referencing the implementation specifications in § 170.215(c) may use the SMART v1, SMART v2, or SMART v2.2 Guides for the time period up to and including December 31, 2025. Then by January 1, 2026, when the adoption of SMART v1 expires, developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to criteria referencing the implementation specifications in § 170.215(c) must update to the SMART v2 or SMART v2.2 Guides and provide the updated version to their customers in order to maintain certification of that Health IT Module. Finally, by January 1, 2028, when the adoption of the SMART v2 Guide expires, developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to criteria referencing the implementation specifications in § 170.215(c) must update to the SMART v2.2 Guide and provide the updated health IT module to their customers in order to maintain certification of that Health IT Module. We propose that any Health IT Modules seeking certification to criteria referencing the implementation specifications in § 170.215(c) on or after January 1, 2028, would need to be capable of supporting the SMART v2.2 Guide.</P>",

      "<P>\n                        To reference the SMART Guide across these proposed new and revised certification criteria, we propose to move the SMART Guide component references (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         specific capabilities and sections) out of the subparagraphs in § 170.215(c), so that only entire SMART Guide references are listed under § 170.215(c).

In the final rule entitled “Health Information Technology: Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology” (77 FR 54163) we discussed the benefits of adopting newer versions of minimum standards code sets, including the improved interoperability and implementation of health IT with minimal additional burden (77 FR 54170). As we stated in the HTI-1 Final Rule, when determining whether to propose newer versions of minimum standards code sets, we consider the impact on interoperability and whether a newer version would require substantive effort for developers of certified health IT to implement (89 FR 1224). If adopted, newer versions of minimum standards code sets would serve as the baseline for certification and developers of certified health IT would be able to use newer versions of these adopted standards on a voluntary basis. We reiterate that while minimum standard code sets update frequently, perhaps several times in a single year, these updates are confined to concepts within the code system, not substantive changes to the standards themselves.</P>",

The widespread use of CD-ROMs and other physical media to share diagnostic quality images persists despite the adoption of PACS and VNA systems, the implementation of web-based viewers for diagnostic imaging, and the emergence of electronic standards and profiles meant to facilitate medical image access and exchange.

We describe in subsequent paragraphs the criterion-specific details of the proposals to require support for imaging links in the Program. We believe that support for imaging links in these certification criteria will promote the availability of electronic image access for patients and providers. To enable a consistent understanding of “imaging link” across certification criteria requirements in the Program, we propose to define “imaging link” in § 170.102 to be “technical details which enable the electronic viewing or retrieval of one or more images over a network.” The proposed definition of “imaging link” is intended to be sufficiently broad to include the technical details used by the protocols and technologies implemented by industry to view and retrieve images. We also note that there is no specific standard associated with the support of this link, and that the functionality of this requirement can be met with a context-sensitive link to an external application which provides access to images and their associated narrative. The DICOMweb standard (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         DICOM PS3.18 2023d—Web Services) \n                        <SU>36</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         is likely to be among the standards widely used by hospitals and providers to support imaging links, but the Health IT Module certified to these certification criteria is not required to support a specific standard. We also clarify that although this proposal does not include specific security standards, we expect the appropriate authentication and authorization processes to be supported to prevent unauthorized access via the imaging links required in this proposal. For example, health IT developers may consider SMART Health Links as one possible standard by which to generate secure links to patient images.\n                    </P>",

We propose that Health IT Modules support this functionality on and after January 1, 2028.

We believe that users and health care providers are best situated to determine which clinical data and data sources require manual review and which are better suited to automatic reconciliation and incorporation. To ensure that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(2) have the capability to support user-driven automatic reconciliation and incorporation, we propose in § 170.315(b)(2)(vi), that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(2) would need to provide functionality that would allow automatic reconciliation and incorporation, without manual review, for each of the \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63524\"/>\n                        applicable USCDI data elements.

      "<P>We note that automatic incorporation means any process by which USCDI data elements contained within C-CDAs are automatically reconciled with information within certified health IT and incorporated in the health IT without an action by a clinician end user or their delegate. These processes include (1) reconciling new information from the C-CDA into the Health IT Module, for instance, by comparison of medication information in the Health IT Module and information in the C-CDA; or (2) determining that no new information needs to be incorporated into the Health IT Module. We welcome comment on this proposal.</P>",
      "<P>We believe that these revisions would provide users with the ability to configure their workflows in such a way as to maximize patient care while minimizing provider effort to perform reconciliation and incorporation. As we have stated in a previous rule when expanding CIRI requirements, “we believe that EHR technology can be designed to assist users in remarkable ways and that reconciling information from multiple sources in a way that is assistive to a user is something at which EHR technology should excel” (77 FR 13849). We believe this proposal is aligned with similar functionalities that many developers are already developing. Our goal is to advance baseline functionality while also leaving room for innovation. We propose that Health IT Modules must support the proposed automatic reconciliation and incorporation capabilities on and after January 1, 2028. We welcome comment on this proposed functionality.</P>"

Since the final rule was published, health IT developers and health care providers have described several challenges meeting this requirement, including development burden; lower than expected adoption and use; and duplicative, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory data from multiple sources. Due in part to these challenges and market forces that have prevented some developers from adopting this functionality natively, developers have had to rely on third-party applications to achieve certification, and in some cases, are unable to achieve certification for electronic prescribing altogether.

CMS subsequently finalized in the “Medicare Program; Secure Electronic Prior Authorization for Medicare Part D” final rule in § 423.160(b)(8)(ii) that beginning January 1, 2022, Part D sponsors and prescribers must use the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 201701 (85 FR 86832).

This is intended to facilitate communication between prescribers and pharmacists, to improve the efficiency of prescribing and dispensing activities, and to help reduce the opportunity for errors.

      "<P>\n                        As noted above, section 119(b) of the CAA, 2021, amended the definition of a “qualified electronic health record” (Qualified EHR) in section 3000(13) of the PHSA to specify that a qualified electronic health record “includes, or is capable of including, a real-time benefit tool that conveys patient-specific real-time cost and coverage information with respect to prescription drugs.” In the 2014 Edition Final Rule, we established the term “Base EHR,” based on the Qualified EHR definition in PHSA \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63531\"/>\n                        section 3000(13), for use within the Program (77 FR 54262). We define Base EHR in § 170.102, and this definition currently includes certification criteria under the Program that align with the elements of the Qualified EHR definition in the PHSA.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Given that the statutory definition of Qualified EHR is implemented in regulation through the Base EHR definition in § 170.102, we believe it is necessary to propose to update the Base EHR definition consistent with Congress' modification of the statutory definition of Qualified EHR to address real-time benefit tool functionality. Specifically, consistent with PHSA section 3000(13), as amended by section 119(b) of the CAA, 2021, we propose to revise the Base EHR definition in § 170.102 to add paragraph (3)(iv) to include the real-time prescription benefit certification criterion proposed in § 170.315(b)(4) on and after January 1, 2028. We believe including the “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion as part of the Base EHR definition will increase the use of real-time prescription benefit tools and promote widespread adoption which will help to lower drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries, consistent with section 119 of the CAA. Use of real-time prescription benefit tools enable Medicare providers and enrollees to make cost-informed decisions about prescriptions, and a standardized approach will ensure that critical drug and drug price data is available to providers when they need it.</P>",
      "<P>We note that in the Part D and Health IT Standards Final Rule CMS finalized to require Part D plan sponsors to adhere to NCPDP RTPB standard version 13 as part of requirements to provide a prescriber real-time benefit tool by January 1, 2027 in the Part D and Health IT Standards Final Rule (89 FR 51259 and 51260). We request comment on whether we should seek to align the date when the “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(4) would be effective for the Base EHR definition (proposed to be January 1, 2028) with the date finalized in the Part D and Health IT Standards Final Rule for Part D plan sponsors' real-time benefit tools to adhere to the NCPDP RTPB standard version 13 (January 1, 2027) (89 FR 51260).</P>",
      "<P>The amended definition of a Qualified EHR in PHSA section 3000(13)(c) further specifies that “with respect to any health information technology certified for electronic prescribing, the technology shall be capable of incorporating the information described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (2)(B).” We interpret this provision to mean, for the purposes of the Program, that any health IT presented for certification for electronic prescribing capabilities should also be capable of incorporating the real-time benefit information specified in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) of section 1860D-4(o) of the Social Security Act, as described above.</P>",
      "<P>Real-time prescription benefit functionality is closely related to electronic prescribing functionality, which provides the basic workflow within which a provider may seek to identify information about a patient's coverage for a certain prescription before transmitting that electronic prescription to the pharmacy. In most cases, we expect health IT developers seeking certification to § 170.315(b)(4) will already be certified to § 170.315(b)(3), though there will be some variation due to the modularity of Program criteria. Accordingly, we propose to revise § 170.550(g) to add paragraph (g)(6) in order to require that any developer that obtains certification for the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) must also obtain certification for the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” criterion in § 170.315(b)(4).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        While we propose to establish this dependency with the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion, this certification criterion is not included as part of the current Base EHR definition in § 170.102. Although electronic prescribing is a widely used and fundamental capability of health IT, we have, to date, not included this certification criterion in the Base EHR definition for several reasons. First, the Qualified EHR definition in section 3000(13) of the PHSA does not specify electronic prescribing as a required element of a Qualified EHR and we have generally sought to limit the Base EHR definition in § 170.102, which implements the Qualified EHR definition, to those capabilities that are required for the Qualified EHR definition by statute. Second, many health care providers have historically been required to adopt certified technology for electronic prescribing in order to meet the requirements of the Medicare EHR Incentive Programs, now known as the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).\n                        <SU>60</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Objectives and measures for eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and CAHs under these programs have included measures related to electronic prescribing throughout the course of the programs. Section 1848(o)(2)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act also requires that demonstration of use of certified EHR technology in a meaningful manner by an eligible professional “shall include the use of electronic prescribing.”\n                    </P>",

      "<P>However, given our proposal to include the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(4) in the Base EHR definition, we believe it is also appropriate to add the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) to the Base EHR definition. While we previously did not include this capability in the Base EHR definition for the reasons described above, we believe that the inclusion of closely related “real-time prescription benefit” functionality in § 170.315(b)(4) necessitates the inclusion of electronic prescribing functionality. We therefore propose to include the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) within the Base EHR definition in § 170.102. We further propose to specify that this criterion would be effective for the Base EHR definition on and after January 1, 2028, which aligns with the date when the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(4) would be effective for the Base EHR definition.</P>",
      "<P>We request comment on these proposals, especially regarding the impact of these proposals on health IT developers seeking to ensure their products meet the Base EHR definition that are not currently separately certified to the “electronic prescribing” criterion. We seek information on the additional burden to developers of requiring the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion as part of the Base EHR definition in addition to the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion. We also request comment on the implications for interoperability of electronic prescribing if we were to finalize our proposal to include the “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion within the Base EHR definition but not finalize our proposal to include the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion in the Base EHR definition.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Lastly, we request comment on the impact this proposed policy would have on any health care providers participating in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) who have historically been able to claim an exclusion from electronic prescribing \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63532\"/>\n                        measures in these programs, and, as a result have not adopted certified health IT for electronic prescribing in order to complete the actions associated with these measures. The definitions of certified EHR technology at 42 CFR 495.4 and 42 CFR 414.1305, which define technology requirements for these programs, cross-reference the Base EHR definition at 45 CFR 171.102. Thus, as a result of the statutory change implemented by Congress, and if our proposals to add these certification criteria to the Base EHR definition are finalized, all providers participating in these programs would have to have at a minimum, health IT certified to the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion and the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion. This would include participants that currently successfully participate in these programs without possessing certified health IT that supports these capabilities. We request comment on whether finalizing these proposals would impose significant burden on these health care providers.\n                    </P>"

RTPBRequest and RTPBResponse transactions are determined by patient, benefit, and product-specific information. Each request and response are unique with information conditioned on factors associated with each transaction. Health IT Modules certified to the proposed certification criterion should support transaction segments and associated data elements necessary to reflect both the information needed for a successful RTPBRequest and the information contained in a detailed RTPBResponse. As such, a Health IT Module must have the capability to send and receive both mandatory and situational transaction segments and associated data elements for RTPBRequests and RTPBResponse transactions as specified in NCPDP RTPB standard version 13. Finally, we propose in § 170.315(b)(4)(i)(C) that a Health IT Module certified to the proposed criterion must enable a user to be notified of errors when there is a problem with a real-time prescription benefit transaction, in accordance with the RTPBError transaction.</P>",

Additionally, commenters recommended that ONC should test the format each individual health IT developer has chosen for its own system to be tested in. Some commentors also shared a desire to move away from XML and EDI altogether, preferring the JSON format instead, noting industry plans for the future retirement of XML and EDI. One commenter suggested certification in either format, with requirements that health IT be capable of demonstrating translation capabilities between EDI and XML.</P>",

We noted that in the 2015 Edition Final Rule, ONC included a “Drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(10). However, ONC did not adopt the proposed NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard version 3.0 to support this criterion due to comments received in response to the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule (80 FR 16821). The drug formulary and preferred drug list checks § 170.315(a)(10) certification criterion was later removed from the Program in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25660) because this functionality was widely available, and there was not sufficient reason to justify the burden on developers and providers of meeting Program compliance requirements specific to this criterion. We noted that updates, enhancements, and corrections have been made to the NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard since we considered adopting version 3.0, and many of these updates addressed concerns commenters expressed previously (87 FR 23854).</P>",
      "<P>Subsequently, in the Part D and Health IT Standards Final Rule, we finalized adoption of NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard version 60 in § 170.205(u) (89 FR 51260), reflecting an aligned approach with the Part D Program to adoption of standards that support electronic prescribing. In the same rulemaking, CMS finalized to cross-reference NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard version 60 in the requirements for transmitting formulary and benefit information between prescribers Part D sponsors proposed at 42 CFR 423.160(b)(3) (89 FR 51250 and 51251). However, we did not make any updates to the Program to incorporate the proposed Formulary and Benefit standard as part of certification criteria.</P>",
      "<P>In response to our request for comment in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, some commenters supported incorporation of capabilities to access formulary and benefits information within the Program based on the NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard. However, many stated that a certification criterion based on the standard is not necessary as this functionality is already widespread in the industry due to existing CMS regulatory requirements. Furthermore, these commenters stated that a criterion based on the NCPDP Formulary and Benefit standard may limit innovation around other approaches to obtaining formulary and benefit information currently being explored by the industry.</P>",
      "<P>We have considered the comments received in response to the RFI and have determined not to propose new functionality related to formulary and benefits information within the Program at this time. We also note that we have proposed to adopt the HL7 FHIR Da Vinci—Payer Data Exchange (PDex) US Drug Formulary Implementation Guide, version 2.0.1—STU 2, in § 170.215(m)(i) in this proposed rule and have referenced this standard as part of the “patient access API” certification criterion proposed in § 170.315(g)(30)(iii).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Section 1860D-4(o)(2)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act, as added by section 119(a) of the CAA, 2021, specifically requires real-time benefit tools capable of providing information on “cost-sharing information and the negotiated price” for drugs and alternatives. However, we note that we have not proposed to include negotiated price in the proposed § 170.315(b)(4) certification criterion. The NCPDP RTPB \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63534\"/>\n                        standard version 13 does not include fields to support the exchange of negotiated price. We solicited comments regarding negotiated price in response to the RFI, and commenters expressed strong disapproval for the inclusion of negotiated price in RTBTs. Additionally, concerns were shared that plan negotiated prices may be confusing to providers and patients and are not likely to assist or improve the utility or usability of technology certified to a real-time prescription benefit certification criterion. We also note that CMS does not require the exchange of negotiated price by Part D sponsors when implementing an electronic real-time benefit tool. NCPDP RTPB standard version 13, which we have proposed to incorporate into the proposed “real-time prescription benefit” certification criterion, is the best available standard for use currently to provide patient specific cost-sharing information. Unfortunately, we have not identified a standard or any consistent approach to deliver reliable negotiated price information in real-time. ONC will continue to work with CMS and other interested parties to determine how negotiated price information may be made available and what technical approaches exist to support transparency in negotiated prices of drugs.\n                    </P>"

The certification criterion's conformance requirements were intended to support two contexts in which we believe that all EHI produced and electronically managed by a developer's technology should be made readily available for export as a capability of certified health IT. First, we finalized in § 170.315(b)(10)(i) that health IT certified to this criterion must support single patient EHI export upon a valid request by a patient or a user on the patient's behalf. Second, we finalized in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii) that the product would support the export of all EHI when a health care provider chooses to transition or migrate information to another health IT system. Furthermore, we established in § 170.402(a)(4), as part of the Assurances Condition of Certification requirement, that any certified Health IT Module that is part of a health IT product which electronically stores EHI must certify to the certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10).</P>",

Subsequently, ONC has heard from developers that some certified Health IT Modules act primarily as intermediaries between systems and, through integration, function without any direct human interaction. As an example, a Health IT Module may facilitate public health reporting by processing existing EHI into a required format for report submission without any user interactions. In such circumstances, a human user may not interact with the certified Health IT Module itself; and even though the Health IT Module stores EHI or causes EHI to be stored, this EHI may be a differently formatted copy of the EHI that already exists in a different, yet integrated, certified Health IT Module.</P>"

We propose this new exemption in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(F), and we caveat the availability of this exemption in two ways. First, in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(F)(\n                        <E T=\"03\">1</E>\n                        ) we propose to require that the EHI stored, or caused to be stored, by the Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(10) must be a copy, whether in the same or another format, of EHI also stored by another Health IT Module with which the Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(10) is integrated. Second, in order to ensure that such an exemption is appropriately limited to Health IT Modules that primarily function without user interaction and from which users would only rarely seek single patient EHI export consistent with § 170.315(b)(10)(i), we further propose in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(F)(\n                        <E T=\"03\">2</E>\n                        ) that any Health IT Module for which the developer receives more than 10 requests in the immediately preceding calendar year for a single patient EHI export would no longer qualify for this exemption and would need to provide functionality under § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(B) without subsequent developer assistance to operate. For purposes of this exemption, we clarify that requests for a single patient EHI export would be counted at the product-level rather than the individual instance-level. This means any request made across all deployed settings or deployed instances of the Health IT Module would count towards this proposed threshold. We note that the developer must still meet all other requirements in § 170.315(b)(10), but that such an exemption would allow them flexibility in how single patient EHI export is provided under § 170.315(b)(10)(i), including providing the export with developer assistance similar to how they provide patient population EHI export under § 170.315(b)(10)(ii).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We note that the limited circumstance defined here would not be applicable to health information exchanges or networks.

      "<P>\n                        Encryption of server-side data prevents unauthorized data access in many scenarios, including those involving a server breach, theft, or improper disposal. Mitigating these risks using encryption is a best practice for all server developers and, given the unique characteristics of EHI, is especially important for health IT server developers. EHI is considered one of the most valuable types of personal information for theft because of the breadth of information included in electronic health records and the long shelf life of this information. However, despite its high value, EHI often is not being properly protected, and the problem is getting worse according to data published on the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) website. Between 2010 and 2022, OCR received 5,144 reports of breaches affecting 500 or more individuals, impacting a total of 394,236,737 individuals.\n                        <SU>67</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         The frequency of breaches affecting 500 individuals or more has increased significantly over the past few years, with almost two such breaches reported per day in 2022, nearly double the frequency in 2018.\n                        <SU>68</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         These statistics indicate that vulnerabilities and risks exist in technology storing EHI in the United States.

      "<P>First, to clarify the scope of electronic health information that needs to be protected in Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(d)(7), we propose that on and after January 1, 2026 the information that must be protected within Health IT Modules certified to this revised criterion in § 170.315(d)(7) include all personally identifiable information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to, individually identifiable health information meeting the definition of electronic protected health information in 45 CFR 160.103, regardless of whether the information is held by or for a HIPAA covered entity or entity required to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended.</P>",
      "<P>Second, we propose to revise existing requirements in § 170.315(d)(7) to include new requirements for server-side encryption and include the PII encryption requirements for servers in a way that maintains our existing end-user device encryption requirements and applies the existing encryption standard and the default settings requirements broadly in one criterion.</P>",
      "<P>We propose to change the name of § 170.315(d)(7) to “health IT encryption,” to better describe the end-user and proposed server-side requirements together. We also propose moving our existing end-user device encryption requirements, in § 170.315(d)(7)(i) and (ii), into paragraph § 170.315(d)(7)(i) that expires on January 1, 2026 and is replaced by a new PII encryption requirement for end-user devices in § 170.315(d)(7)(ii) that must be met on and after January 1, 2026.</P>",
      "<P>Additionally, we propose including the new server-side encryption requirement in § 170.315(d)(7)(iii) that must be met on and after January 1, 2026. We propose that this new server encryption requirement in § 170.315(d)(7)(iii) state that technology designed to store PII must encrypt the stored PII after use of the technology on those servers stops.</P>",

Additionally, we propose that these encryption standard and default settings requirements apply to the new server encryption requirement. Pointing to an encryption standard and requiring that default settings be in place for encryption capabilities in § 170.315(d)(7) is consistent with our existing requirements for end-user device encryption, and we believe these \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63536\"/>\n                        settings are necessary for our proposed new server encryption requirement as well.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>While certain conformance requirements within the proposed § 170.315(d)(7) have been reorganized, as is outlined in the previous paragraphs, health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to this criterion will continue to have traceability. If we were to finalize the updates to § 170.315(d)(7) as proposed, developers with Health IT Modules already certified to § 170.315(d)(7) would only need to consider updates to the applicable encryption standards, server-side encryption, and encryption of any non-encrypted PII for the purposes of maintaining Health IT Module certification in the future.</P>",

In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule we clarified that “encrypting authentication credentials could include password encryption or cryptographic hashing” (85 FR 25700).

      "<P>We propose to revise the Program's current certification criteria related to public health in § 170.315(f); add several new functional requirements and adopt newer versions of standards within the current (f) criteria; add two additional certification criteria in the current (f) criteria for birth reporting and bi-directional exchange with a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP); adopt new certification criteria for health IT for public health in § 170.315(f)(21) through (29); adopt enhancements to the standardized API for patient and population services in § 170.315(g)(10) (see section III.B.19); and adopt a new certification criterion for a standardized FHIR-based API for public health data exchange in § 170.315(g)(20), which we also propose to adopt as part of the Base EHR definition. Additionally, we propose to revise the naming of the (f) criteria to reflect first the public health use case, followed by the functionality the certification criterion supports. We believe this will help support clarity for both the use case and the specific capabilities as we continue to expand health IT supports for public health data exchange. While the proposed (f) criteria updates and additions focus primarily on health IT for public health, we believe it is likely that these certification criteria may be used in other use cases and settings.</P>",
      "<P>In general, we seek to frame health IT certification criteria so that the certified health IT can be used by a wide range of entities in a different setting—including by health care providers, researchers, PHAs, or third-party entities supporting public health use cases defined in § 170.315(f), such as health information networks or other types of registries. For these public health use cases, we propose to group functions within use cases based on the implementation guides and the transactions within a bi- or multi-directional information exchange workflow. These functions may be part of a wide range of technologies, employed by a wide range of users, and we remain agnostic to the specific entity that may purchase any health IT product certified to the functionality. As such, we use the term “health IT for public health” to support the functions and transactions in the public health use cases in § 170.315(f)(21) through (29).

We intend for this approach to allow for systems to mature and advance in an aligned fashion, reduce the need for manual workarounds and intervention, and lead to wider adoption of modern standards-based capabilities.</P>",
      "<P>We understand that some health IT certification terms used in ONC's regulations for specific technical actions or capabilities may not be the same uses of the terms by the public health or healthcare sector when discussing programmatic activities. For example, in the Program we use the term “validate” in reference to the technical capability to correctly identify if a structured document or message received is conformant to a standard and if formats or vocabulary standards are valid or invalid. This is a necessary technical step to map data received in an interoperable manner. Public health or quality reporting related organizations may use the term “validate” to refer to an organizational or programmatic process to support program integrity, data accuracy, and data quality. In order to maintain consistency within the Program and to provide clarity for health IT developers, we use terms that describe health IT software functions that—while they may enable such activities by users—are specific to technical requirements. In addition, we use terms that are consistent across certification criteria—such as receive, validate, parse, and filter—to clearly and consistently define health IT functions in a manner that supports health IT developers participating in the Program. The capabilities we propose in this manner are intended to advance tools which can be used in a variety of ways to support greater efficacy across multiple programmatic and organizational use cases and processes for the public health and healthcare community.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Prior experiences with the Program demonstrated an imperative to test both the sending and receiving of information, particularly in HL7 messages and documents. The initial requirement of Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) in early iterations of the Program only included the functionality to create and send, resulting in multiple deviations and variations of the same document type and creating challenges with receiving the same standard from different vendors. Such variability included different formatting, such as line and page breaks or representation of date, as well as including or excluding specific data elements, such as onset time of problem.\n                        <SU>104</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         These variations, while allowed under the Program at the time, made receiving, integrating, and interpreting CCDs challenging. However, when certification requirements and associated testing expectations were updated to include the receipt of CCDs as well, there was a noticeable improvement in consistency. Over time, implementation guides developed through standards development organizations became more constrained, with fewer areas of optionality, and companion guides supplemented these IGs, reducing the variations discussed above, and improving interoperability.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>These lessons in the early implementation of the Program were considered when developing the current proposals. For public health reporting, only sending systems—namely health IT used by health care providers—have been held to requirements for transmission. Similar divergence in minimum system capabilities and variable adoption and use of established national standards between certified health IT developers and health IT for public health have created challenges for PHAs, which have struggled to make use of data that is not consistent, even when it conforms to a healthcare standard. At best, these differences result in significant inefficiencies, as PHAs must develop manual workarounds and custom tools that standardize and format incoming data to reduce processing time and improve receipt, data mapping, and parsing processes. At worst, these differences impede public health's ability to quickly translate data it receives from healthcare into actions that protect and support the health of all people and their communities.</P>",
      "<P>By establishing minimum functional capabilities and exchange standards for health IT and health IT for public health to send and receive public health data, we expect to enhance interoperability across healthcare and public health and provide a long-term mechanism for alignment as data exchange matures over time.

However, many of these issues are not specific to the pandemic and are instead due to the existing infrastructure and low adoption of current standards. Health IT Modules currently exchange older versions of the electronic laboratory reporting standard that no longer fully meet the needs of public health. We recognize there are also issues facing laboratory reporting and interoperability related to local codes and the manual effort involved with mapping local codes to standard codes. We received feedback about the challenges and time it takes for the mapping needed for exchange, and the downstream issues that occur if the mapping is not completed. However, we do not believe this can be solved solely through updates to the Program, which can require that technology support standard codes but cannot mandate that users record data using such standard codes.

      "<P>We also propose the inclusion of an additional requirement within the cancer registry reporting certification criterion, to include cancer pathology reporting. Cancer pathology reporting is an important component of diagnosing cancer and understanding how advanced cases are at the point of diagnosis. Pathology reporting for this certification criterion has not been part of our Program in the past, but we have heard feedback that pathology laboratory data is not being collected or exchanged in a standard way. Having standardized, electronic pathology reports would be an important foundation to more complete and accurate understanding of cancer diagnoses and assessing the stage at diagnosis. However, for cancer registries to receive all the information needed for accurate assessment, the data elements within the LRI IG are not enough for cancer pathology reporting. As such, CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries has been actively working with state PHAs and pathology partners, including the College of American Pathologists (CAP), to develop and pilot a FHIR Implementation Guide for cancer pathology reporting: Cancer Pathology Data Sharing 1.0.0—STU1. Early results of these pilots demonstrate that use of this implementation guide will reduce the need for manual intervention and data cleansing, aid in more timely reporting, and include data elements that are important for public health action.</P>",

With most U.S. births occurring in hospitals or free-standing birthing facilities, birth reporting typically entails clinicians supplying the medical and health information for the birth certificate to a \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63547\"/>\n                        state web-based Electronic Birth Registration System (EBRS) or nonclinical hospital staff reviewing the hospital medical records for the information and entering it into the state EBRS. The legal and demographic information is typically collected directly from the mother using a standardized worksheet, and the information is then entered into the State EBRS by nonclinical hospital staff. This information is then sent to the state and a birth certificate is then issued by the state vital records authority. Much of the medical and health information collected for the birth certificate necessary to report a live birth is also dually entered into EHRs by health care providers. As a result, birth reporting processes are duplicative and burdensome for providers and hospital systems.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Low adoption of standards to exchange data between EHRs and EBRSs have resulted in an overall lack of interoperability between all systems involved in birth reporting processes. CDC has provided significant funding and resources to support the adoption of EBRSs by PHAs and providers. Recent funding has also been provided to PHAs to develop and advance the use of the FHIR standard to report information. Despite investments made by CDC towards standards-based exchange with EBRSs, there has been very little uptake of these standards and associated functionalities by health IT developers.</P>",

Based on public comments on HTI-1 and prior rulemakings, we believe that the health IT industry, healthcare standards developers, and health care providers expect and support ONC making such determinations so that the adopted version of standards are the most up-to-date available and are feasible for real-world implementation (see 89 FR 1215).

      "<P>\n                        As of the publication of this proposed rule, 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories have established PDMPs, each with various requirements for querying and reporting from pharmacy information systems. Of these 54 PDMPs, 51 have additionally implemented regulations mandating the use of the state PDMP when prescribing controlled substances, sometimes for new patients or other scenarios.\n                        <SU>127</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         However, despite the increase in PDMP utilization and promising, though mixed, evidence of their effectiveness, PDMPs are only able to truly impact care if prescribers and pharmacists use them, and when PDMP data are easily accessible in clinical workflows and accessible across state lines. While requirements are in place for providers to access PDMPs at the state level, states generally do not have specific requirements for PDMPs to support direct queries—in practice this leads to indirect query workflows and multiple translation points, creating gaps in interoperability. Additionally, there are no widespread established practices for integrating query information into clinical workflows within health IT systems—despite recommendations from CDC that, when prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should review a patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions as well as non-opioid therapies using state PDMP data.\n                        <SU>128</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         In addition, health IT systems may lack sufficient capabilities to reconcile query data from PDMP systems as discrete data element(s). At the same time, PDMPs also need to be able to respond to a query from a certified Health IT Module with discrete data.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>We note that in our proposed certification criterion, we describe a passive or automated query as well as an active query.

In such a case, the system may be configured to pair with a certified or non-certified Health IT Module that enables the EPCS in order to initiate the query without additional action by the clinician. An active query refers to a query of the PDMP initiated by the user to specifically query the PDMP based on their own clinical considerations. An active query might also be in conjunction with other clinical actions, but it should also enable the user to elect to initiate a query as part of other workflows such as administrative or care coordination actions.

We further propose a requirement for responding to queries from external systems, as well as seek comment on patient access as a complement to the proposed updated requirements in § 170.315(f)(1). Such updates will provide clinicians with querying access to IISs in order to better determine the vaccination status of their patients, among other benefits. By including functions performed by health IT for public health within a certification criterion, the Program advances its focus on bi-directional interoperability between healthcare and PHAs. Such functionality for receipt, validation, query/response, and patient access should enable more users, including those using a variety of health IT systems, to have the most complete and accurate vaccine history for individuals. This functionality can help advance EHRs, IISs, and intermediaries in alignment, with the same foundational functionalities, and keep data moving with the speed of care. If an individual receives a vaccine from a pharmacy, from a community health clinic, away from their home state, or at their provider's office, any approved user regardless of their health IT should be able to have access to their complete, accurate vaccine history.

      "<P>As discussed earlier in the section regarding proposed revisions to § 170.315(f)(8), the process of birth reporting has traditionally relied on a provider manually entering data into a web portal, which is used by the jurisdiction's office of vital statistics to produce a birth certificate and report selected data items to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Birth reporting helps inform public health programs on important health indicators, including birth rates and infant mortality rates, is used for research, and is used to produce the birth certificates needed for proof of identification, accessing benefits, and other administrative purposes. Our proposal for § 170.315(f)(8) would provide an electronic birth reporting option—that could greatly reduce manual effort if adopted—using the new proposed standard in § 170.205(v).</P>",

Adoption of the FHIR-based approach would align the health IT used by public health receiving birth reports with those sending birth reports. Inclusion of the ability to receive and validate FHIR-specific birth reporting within applicable health IT for public health will also provide a baseline set of capabilities that vendors of health IT for public health can build on as additional FHIR-based approaches emerge for public health, including bulk import of data and FHIR Questionnaires.

As mentioned in the earlier discussion regarding a new proposed certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(9), a provider's ability to query information from a PDMP “can help identify patients who may be at risk for overdose.” \n                        <SU>154</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         PDMP data can also “be helpful when patient medication history is unavailable and when care transitions to a new clinician.” \n                        <SU>155</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         To complement our proposal to support certification of health IT used by providers to be capable of requesting data from PDMP databases, we also believe it is important to certify the capability of health IT for public health, in this case PDMPs, to respond to queries submitted. While it is expected that most PDMPs support this requirement today, inclusion of the functionality in the Program will support PDMPs capabilities in alignment with requirements for health IT systems to request and validate PDMP information. Our proposal will also require that functionality is based on open, consensus-based practices where possible, allowing PDMPs to have the ability to exchange information without undue burden. Additionally, PDMPs should have the capability to support interstate data sharing (or queries) to better inform prescribing practices, improve patient care and safety, monitor patient behaviors that contribute to the opioid epidemic, and facilitate a nimble and targeted response.\n                    </P>",

Current efforts have been hampered by a history of bespoke solutions and a multitude of projects, contracts, and implementations that struggled to scale or sustain adequate funding, limiting adoption of resulting standards or implementation guides. This limited adoption of standards and mechanisms for electronic public health data exchange, among other challenges, has resulted in poor interoperability that often relies on manual effort, such as phone calls, faxes, and data entry.</P>",
      "<P>The COVID-19 pandemic stressed our public health system and surfaced flaws in the data that public health officials obtain from health care providers—both in the data itself, but also the ways in which data are reported. As a result, public health officials' access to critical health data during public health emergencies or disasters lags, and their experience varies with respect to the use of technology to glean insights to inform decisions on quarantines, hospital capacity, public health education campaigns, distribution of critical medical supplies, school closures, reopening after a pandemic, and many other essential public health decisions.</P>",
      "<P>Without modern standards and consistent requirements to adopt standards-based IT systems, public health data exchange often relies on custom, siloed solutions, and manual workarounds. Currently, most public health data exchange relies on older versions of HL7 v2 or CDA standards. HL7 v2 and CDA standards support simple, single-patient, event-based submission of documents from healthcare to PHAs, but these standards do not adequately support more complex data exchange use cases, such as bulk exchange of patients who received a specific vaccine. However, now that the majority of hospitals and office-based clinicians nationwide have adopted FHIR-based APIs with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) for patient and population level services, the technical landscape has evolved, and today's health IT infrastructure presents the public health ecosystem with vastly improved options to engage in more granular data exchange. The shift to HL7 FHIR is needed to support a wide-scale public health response, and we believe broad adoption of HL7 FHIR would reduce burden of implementation and maintenance for data exchange between and among healthcare organizations, providers, and PHAs.</P>",

This new certification criterion would support ongoing and future development of public health FHIR IGs leveraging a core set of existing, modular, and extensible capabilities and standards.

The consistent functionalities established in the combination of § 170.315(g)(10) and § 170.315(g)(20) would support the creation or revision of health IT for public health IGs necessary to advance interoperability for specific use cases, such as cancer pathology reporting, which has a draft FHIR IG, or immunization reporting, which is currently only supported by a HL7 v2-based IG. Using HL7 FHIR-based APIs, PHAs and healthcare partners could create an ecosystem where health IT for public health can securely query data directly from the source, in real time, when needed, based on an initial push of relevant data. Helios tested this approach and participants were able to successfully query EHRs for additional patient-level information after an initial trigger, and we are working with CDC to pilot and scale this approach.\n                        <SU>159</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                    </P>",

      "<P>Third, we believe that the proposed certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(20) would serve as a glidepath towards an eventual transition to broader HL7 FHIR-based reporting for public health data exchange. We propose that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(20) would support modular and foundational capabilities and standards, such server support for subscriptions in § 170.315(j)(23), and support a public health specific set of HL7 FHIR profiles that extend the requirements in § 170.315(g)(10) to support a public health transition to HL7 FHIR.</P>",
      "<P>Finally, we believe this approach will minimize development burden by relying heavily on the standards and capabilities already required of Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10), while supporting near-term development and authoring of public health use case-specific HL7 FHIR IGs, where necessary, to transmit relevant data to PHAs. We emphasize for clarity that just because we propose to adopt a public health-focused API certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(20), developers of certified health IT are not required to build one API per criterion (if they are also certified to § 170.315(g)(10) for example). Developers of certified health IT would have flexibility to certify and deploy APIs scoped however they want, if and as they certify Health IT Modules to multiple API-based certification criteria, including those proposed to be included as part of the Base EHR definition in § 170.102, including certification criteria in § 170.315(g)(10), (g)(20), (g)(30) and (g)(34).</P>",

We propose that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(20) support read and search capabilities for each HL7 FHIR Resource identified in § 170.315(g)(20)(iii)(A) according to the standards and implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(b)(2).

The UDAP Security IG v1 enables dynamic registration in alignment with the OAuth 2.0 security paradigm already in use in the Program. The SMART App Launch IG, which profiles the OAuthAuthorization Framework established in RFC 6749, is currently required in the Program in the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion to enable secure authorization of apps to receive a single patient's data via FHIR. Additionally, the SMART Backend Services specification, also profiling OAuth 2.0, already required in the Program in the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion for authorization to retrieve multiple patient's data. The UDAP Security IG v1 would augment the existing OAuth 2.0 found in the Program by enabling scalable and standardized application registration capabilities compatible with FHIR and the SMART App Launch IG to be referenced as requirements in Program API criteria. While the UDAP Security IG v1 defines additional capabilities beyond dynamic registration, Program API criteria requirements proposed in this rule focus on dynamic registration and subsequent authorization requests of dynamically registered apps.

Participation in a trust community can be represented in a secure and trustworthy manner in the form of cryptographically secure digital certificates. These certificates enable an application to prove to a server that it and its developer are trusted to meet the expectations of the trust community. With the certificate as proof of the trustworthiness of an API User and their application, registration can proceed in an automated manner without the need to perform manual or non-standardized trust verification.</P>",

Depending on the scenario, Certified API Developers as well as API Information Sources would be best positioned to determine which trust communities are supported for dynamic registration at a specific deployment. Under this proposal to adopt the UDAP Security IG v1, we have not proposed to require that all trust communities be supported by a Certified API Developer, nor have we specified a particular trust community. However, if an API User seeks to connect an application that is part of the same trust community as the deployed certified API technology, then dynamic registration must be made available to the API User's application.</P>",

      "<P>As discussed in the ONC Cures Act Proposed and Final Rules, Section 4002 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary of HHS to establish Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for the Program (84 FR 7465, 85 FR 25647). To implement this, ONC established the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, including API Conditions and Maintenance requirements in § 170.404, which establish baseline technical and behavioral requirements for Certified API Developers and their certified API technology. The API Conditions and Maintenance requirements established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule implemented the Cures Act requirement that certified API technology allow “health information from such technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable law” (85 FR 25647). The API Condition of Certification includes three main conditions that focus on transparency, fees, and openness and pro-competitiveness. To complement these conditions, we also adopted in § 170.404(b) Maintenance of Certification requirements that address ongoing, and, at times, frequent experiences Certified API Developers would face, such as app registration with certified API technology.</P>",
      "<P>We propose to revise the app registration-oriented maintenance requirements in § 170.404(b) to align with the proposed registration requirements as part of the certification criteria in § 170.315 (g)(10), (20), (30), and (32)-(35). First, we propose to revise the authenticity verification API Maintenance of Certification requirement in § 170.404(b)(1)(i) to not apply to API Users that are part of a trust community submitting registration requests via the proposed dynamic client registration pathways in the certification criteria in § 170.315 (g)(10), (20), (30), and (32)-(35). Specifically, if the API User is part of a trust community supported by the certified API technology used by an API Information Source and the API User's request to register is conformant to the UDAP Security IG v1, then this Maintenance of Certification requirement shall not apply. We propose to revise the requirement in this manner because API Users that are part of a supported trust community will have already undergone the authenticity verification processes required by the trust community to receive a trust community certificate, and their authenticity for registration can be rapidly proven via verification of their trust community certificate. Therefore, we believe that an additional verification process according to § 170.404(b)(1)(i) by a Certified API Developer for verification of API Users possessing a supported trust community certificate and dynamically registering an app is unnecessary and would hinder dynamic registration of apps at scale.</P>",
      "<P>Second, we propose to revise the registration for production use API Maintenance of Certification requirement in § 170.404(b)(1)(ii) so that the registration timeframe for API Users submitting dynamic registration requests according to the UDAP Security IG v1 is one business day, rather than five business days as otherwise applies. Specifically, if the API User is part of a supported trust community and their request to register is valid and conformant to the UDAP Security IG v1, then the Certified API Developer must register and enable the application for production use within one business day. We propose to revise the requirement in this manner to reflect the reduced time necessary to process the automated dynamic registration request.</P>",
      "<P>Third, we propose to add a new API Maintenance of Certification requirement by revising paragraph § 170.404(b)(2)(iv) to require a Certified API Developer to publish information regarding the trust communities supported at each service base URL published as part of the requirements in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii) that can be used by patients to access their EHI. This proposal includes publication of the trust community name, contact information, and web address, and identifying URL in a machine-readable format at no charge for each service base URL published in accordance with § 170.404(b)(2)(iii) on and after January 1, 2028. We propose that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) may, but are not required, to support trust community discovery for dynamic registration in § 170.404(b)(2)(iv) for the period up to and including December 31, 2027. Additionally, we propose in § 170.404(b)(2)(i)(B) that these trust community details be reviewed quarterly, and, as necessary, updated by Certified API Developers. Finally, we propose to change the title of § 170.404(b)(2) to “publication of API discovery details for patient access” to better reflect the requirements we have proposed for this section.</P>",
      "<P>We believe that these requirements would better facilitate individuals' access, exchange, and use of EHI, consistent with the Cures Act, and build upon the existing foundations established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule by leveraging more advanced standards and enable individuals to access, exchange, and use health data without special effort via dynamic registration using applications of their choice. We welcome public comment on if the requirements for publication of API discovery details for § 170.315(g)(10) should include endpoints enabling provider, bulk, and system access to EHI.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Publication of information regarding supported trust communities enables API Users to know if a trust community they are participating in is also supported at a certified API technology's endpoint conformant to § 170.315(g)(10) or § 170.315(g)(30), and thus if dynamic client registration is supported at that endpoint for patient-facing apps. Without required publication of supported trust communities, API Users may have to query the metadata for each individual certified API technology's endpoint to confirm if their trust community is supported at that endpoint, which would hinder the registration of apps at scale. This requirement for Certified API Developers to publish trust community information would enable API access, exchange, and use of health data “without special effort” by ensuring API User access to information necessary for \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63567\"/>\n                        scalable dynamic registration of patient-facing apps with certified API technology certified to § 170.315(g)(10) or § 170.315(g)(30). We refer readers to the ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule (84 FR 7477) for additional discussion regarding why we believe access to trust community, endpoint, and other API discovery details is a necessary attribute to enable API access, exchange, and use of health data “without special effort.”\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We clarify that Certified API Developers must publish the identifying URI as defined by the trust community, if such a UR is available.

      "<P>\n                        As an alternative to requiring trust community details be published in any machine-readable format at no charge, we seek comment on standards-based publication strategies and formats for the trust community information we propose for § 170.404(b)(2)(iv). We note our proposal earlier in this preamble in section III.B.3 to require service base URLs and related organization details be published in aggregate vendor-consolidate Brand Bundle format according to the User-access Brands and Endpoints (Brands) specification. We seek comment from Certified API Developers on whether they would consider augmenting their Brand Bundle with trust community information. The Brands specification profiles do not specifically account for trust community information, but given the breadth and extensibility of FHIR, the trust community information could theoretically be included in a Brand Bundle in FHIR format (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         using a FHIR extension). If this information is not included in the Brand Bundle, it would need to be published separately in some machine-readable format.

In general, we expect the capabilities in § 170.315(j) would be standards-based and include a combination of new and existing standards, many of which are currently referenced in § 170.315(g)(10). Additionally, we anticipate that the proposed capabilities in § 170.315(j) would enable the Program to better support a growing number of clinical, public health, and administrative use cases over the long-term, as well as foster innovation and competition in these spaces by providing flexibility for modular development approaches among developers of certified health IT.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Section 4002 of the Cures Act requires health IT developers, as a condition of certification, to publish APIs that allow “health information from such technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used \n                        <E T=\"03\">without special effort</E>\n                         through the use of APIs or successor technology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.” (emphasis added). The Cures Act's API Condition of Certification requirement also states that a developer must, through an API, “provide access to all data elements of a patient's electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws.” In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25740), we described our approach to adopting a standardized API for patient and population services certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10). The Standardized API for Patient and Population Services in § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion includes conformance requirements for a combination of standards—including data content standards (such as the USCDI standard) and technical standards (such as the SMART App Launch implementation specification for authentication and authorization)—and functional criteria for other technical capabilities (such as application registration and token introspection).

      "<P>\n                        Over time, we have made updates to previously adopted certification criteria based on the evolution of available standards to support more advanced use cases leveraging similar functionality and increasingly interconnected health IT systems. In addition, we have sought to continuously improve the extensibility of specific conformance requirements so that those conformance requirements can support functionality in different types of health IT, and so that complex systems can be certified in a modular fashion. By using the term “modular” we mean certification criteria in the Program that are scoped to limited capabilities to enable health IT developers to certify to the specific certification criteria that apply to Health IT Modules they wish to certify, rather than large, multi-functionality, and all-encompassing certification criteria that would give developers less flexibility for certifying in the Program. The work to support extensibility and modularity of certification criteria within the Program has included cross-referencing aligned standards or capabilities across other certification criteria, which support consistent standards and functionality for related actions both across and within certified capabilities. For example, the certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2) clinical information reconciliation and incorporation references the same standards referenced throughout the transitions of care certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(1), including § 170.205(a)(3) through (5), and the privacy and security certification criteria in § 170.315(d) are conditionally required for certification according to Health IT Module certification requirements for ONC-ACBs described in the privacy and security certification framework in § 170.550(h). Establishing the privacy and security certification framework in § 170.550(h) for ONC-ACBs ensures that Health IT Modules are subject to more specific privacy safeguards and provides more flexibility for certified health IT developers than would be the case if we had a single, \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63568\"/>\n                        multi-functionality privacy and security criterion.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        Throughout the Program's history, we have also adopted both certification criteria that include the full scope of a complex transaction (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         § 170.315(b)(3) electronic prescribing) and certification criteria that include a discrete portion of a transaction (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         § 170.315(c)(1)-(4) clinical quality measures). These different approaches are intended to align our Program requirements to real world implementation scenarios which necessitate both contained execution of complex transactions and the ability to implement related processes across a range of systems in a modular fashion. Our adoption of these varying types of certification criteria allows ONC to administer a more effective and efficient Program, gives developers of certified health IT more nuanced certification options to meet their customers' needs, and promotes a more dynamic marketplace of certified Health IT Modules than would be the case if we bundled different functionalities and standards under fewer certification criteria.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        Based on our analysis of the continued evolution of standards and the real-world implementation scenarios for certified health IT to enable FHIR-based APIs, we are proposing to adopt new certification criteria supporting API capabilities for public health data exchange and patient, provider, and payer data exchange (see sections III.B.13 and III.B.20 respectively). As described in this section, we are proposing to revise § 170.315(g)(10) through references to modular API capabilities proposed as certification criteria in § 170.315(j). These certification criteria include standards, functionalities, and certification conformance requirements that align with or are the exact same as the standards, functionalities, and certification conformance requirements currently referenced in § 170.315(g)(10). In addition, we are proposing to update the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion to cross-reference newly proposed requirements. Specifically, we propose to adopt a suite of modular API capabilities as certification criteria in § 170.315(j) where each criterion focuses on one specific certification conformance requirement, and we propose to reference these certification criteria as applicable in the proposed revisions to the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion (see section III.B.19). For example, we propose to include in § 170.315((j)(1) functional registration, (j)(6) SMART App Launch user authorization, (j)(7) SMART Backend Services system authentication and authorization, (j)(9) SMART Patient Access for Standalone Apps, (j)(10) SMART Clinician Access for EHR Launch. However, we also propose to include in these proposed certification criteria in § 170.315(j) new certification conformance requirements that reflect more recent API standards advancements (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         workflow triggers, verifiable health records, and subscriptions) further described below.\n                    </P>"

These new certification criteria would be available for certification based on certain contexts or other programs requiring the use of the specified certified capabilities.

      "<P>\n                        In § 170.315(j)(1), we propose the “Functional registration” certification criterion which would require that a Health IT Module demonstrate the ability for applications to register with its authorization server. The process of registration is necessary in many health IT workflows and enables an authorization server to establish a scope of information access for applications and share authentication credentials if applicable. This requirement would be similar to what currently exists in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) “Application registration,” which has a functional requirement to “enable an application to register with the Health IT Module's `authorization server.' ” We clarify that for the proposed requirement in § 170.315(j)(1) Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must support application registration regardless of the scope of patient search utilized by the application (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         single or multiple). Additionally, this proposed certification criterion would require a health IT developer to demonstrate its registration process without requiring the use of an identified standard.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 170.315(j)(2), we propose the “Dynamic registration” certification criterion where a Health IT Module demonstrates the ability to dynamically register confidential apps according to the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o), including mandatory support for sections “Home,” “Discovery,” and “Registration” as well as the “community” query parameter as defined in the “Multiple Trust Communities” section of the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o). As described in more detail at section III.B.15 of this proposed rule, the UDAP Security IG v1 would provide a more uniform, standardized, and automated registration pathway for applications.</P>",
      "<P>We propose to reserve § 170.315(j)(3) and (j)(4) for future potential registration capabilities.</P>",
      "<P>In § 170.315(j)(5), we propose to adopt the “Asymmetric certificate-based authentication for patient access” certification criterion where a Health IT Module's authorization server must support authentication during the process of granting access to patient data to patients according to the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o), including support for asymmetric certificate-based authentication as detailed in section “Consumer-Facing” of the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o). Asymmetric certificate-based authentication is a process by which the client and server use public and private keys along with digital certificates for authentication. It is a similar process to asymmetric authentication with the modification that both the client and server verify each other's participation in a trust community. The client and server represent their participation in a trust community through a digital certificate issued by the trust community's certificate authorities. We note that asymmetric certificate-based authentication supports the dynamic client registration proposals included in this rule for adoption in § 170.215(o)(1) (see the section titled New Requirements to Support Dynamic Client Registration Protocol in the Program).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In § 170.315(j)(6) we propose to adopt the “SMART App Launch user authorization” certification criterion where a Health IT Module's authorization server must support user authorization during the process of granting access to patient data according to at least one implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c). We note for this proposal that “user” refers to the end-user of an application, and may refer to either a patient, or a healthcare professional or his or her office staff. We clarify for the purposes of certification to this criterion that support for one type of user is sufficient (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         support for a patient user, or \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63569\"/>\n                        support for a healthcare professional or his or her office staff user). The specific requirements include requiring support for Health IT Modules to issue a refresh token valid for a period of no less than three months to confidential apps and native apps capable of securing a refresh token in § 170.315(j)(6)(i), receive and validate tokens issued by the Health IT Module in accordance with at least one implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c) in § 170.315(j)(6)(ii), and enable for confidential apps persistent access to patient information without requiring user re-authentication or re-authorization until authorization revocation at the user's direction in § 170.315(j)(6)(iii). We further propose in § 170.315(j)(6)(iv) that a Health IT Module's authorization server must be able to revoke and must revoke an authorized application's access at a user's direction within 1 hour of the request. This proposed certification criterion includes the same functions for refresh tokens from § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) “Authentication and authorization for patient and user scopes” as well as authorization revocation and token introspection functions from § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) and (vii), respectively. Regarding support for the issuance of refresh tokens for native apps for this certification criterion, we mirror the conformance expectations established in the Information Blocking and the ONC Health IT Certification Program: Extension of Compliance Dates and Timeframes in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Interim Final Rule (85 FR 70076), namely that health IT developers can determine the method(s) they use to support interactions with native apps and that health IT developers are not required to support all methods that third-party application developers seek to use.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 170.315(j)(7), we propose to adopt the “SMART Backend Services system authentication and authorization” certification criterion where a Health IT Module would support system authentication and authorization during the process of granting a system access to patient data in accordance with the backend services profile of at least one implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c). This certification criterion's conformance requirements are derived from what currently exists in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B) “Authentication and authorization for system scopes,” proposed in § 170.315(j)(7), as well as the token introspection requirements from § 170.315(g)(10)(vii), proposed in § 170.315(j)(7)(i). The proposed token introspection requirements in § 170.315(j)(7)(i) include requiring that a Health IT Module's authorization server must be able to receive and validate tokens it has issued in accordance with at least one implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c). The HL7 standards community re-organized their standards and moved the “SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide” from the Bulk v1 IG (adopted in § 170.215(d)(1)) into the “Backend Services” section of the SMART Application Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0 (adopted in § 170.215(c)(2)).</P>",
      "<P>In § 170.315(j)(8), we propose to adopt the “Asymmetric certificate-based system authentication and authorization” certification criterion where a Health IT Module would support system authentication and authorization for the “client_credentials” grant type during the process of granting access to patient data according to the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o), including support for the “Business-to-Business” section of the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(o). This certification criterion would support system authentication and authorization for business-to-business access use cases within supported trust communities. This certification criterion would be similar in function to the certification criterion proposed in § 170.315(j)(7) in that it would require system authentication and authorization capabilities but would additionally require support for contextual information and certificates as detailed in the UDAP Security IG v1 to enable authentication and authorization within a trust community. Additionally, we propose to include a section for “Token introspection” in § 170.315(j)(8)(i), where a Health IT Module's authorization server must be able to receive and validate tokens it has issued in accordance with at least one implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c). This requirement would be similar to what currently exists in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii) “Token introspection” and is aligned with similar token introspection requirements in § 170.315(j)(6)(ii) and (7)(i).</P>",
      "<P>In § 170.315(j)(9), we propose to adopt the “SMART Patient Access for Standalone Apps” certification criterion where the Health IT Module would support patient authorization and authorization revocation at a patient's direction according to the requirements in § 170.315(j)(6). The capabilities described in the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide have matured and changed over time, and to support a health IT developer's ability to certify using any of the available implementation specifications in § 170.215(c) we propose allowing health IT developers to support one of the following sets of SMART capabilities listed in paragraph (j)(9)(i), (ii), and (iii). We also note that versions of the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide adopted in § 170.215(c) will expire on January 1, 2026 for § 170.215(c)(1), and January 1, 2028 for § 170.215(c)(2), and this proposed structure in § 170.315(j)(9) will support the transition to newer versions of the implementation specification. The first set of SMART capabilities requires up to and including December 31, 2025, support for the “Patient Access for Standalone Apps” Capability Set, as well as the capabilities of “launch-standalone” and “context-standalone-patient,” and the capabilities in subsections “Client Types,” “Single Sign-on,” and “Permissions” except the “permission-user” from § 170.215(c)(1).

      "<P>As discussed in section “SMART App Launch 2.2” of this rule, we propose to no longer reference specific capabilities and sections of the SMART App Launch implementation guide under § 170.215(c). Instead, Program criteria would specify required capabilities of the SMART App Launch implementation guide. In alignment with that proposal, we propose the SMART capabilities as adopted in HTI-1 in § 170.215(c)(1) for SMART App Launch 1.0.0 and § 170.215(c)(2) for SMART App Launch 2.0.0 be moved to the proposed § 170.315(j)(6)-(10) certification criteria.

The proposed certification criteria in § 170.315(j)(9) and (10) would also include conformance dates for each set of required SMART App Launch capabilities that would enable developers as they present their products for certification to move to the newer requirements when they are ready and prior to when a particular conformance requirement may expire, and the other(s) become the new baseline.</P>",

Once the subscription is established, servers can proactively notify a client when new information has been added or existing information has been updated in its system. Once a notification has been received by a client, the client can take appropriate action, including querying the server for the desired information. The HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework also describes methods to transmit payloads with notifications, which may help simplify some interorganizational transactions by enabling real-time updates, selective data transmission, and interoperability, making data exchange between organizations more efficient and effective.</P>",
      "<P>We anticipate that API-based subscriptions will support several use cases across clinical, public health, administrative and research domains. Specific to public health use cases, we envision that future implementation guides could leverage the HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework for case reporting processes, immunization reporting processes, syndromic surveillance, reportable laboratory tests and values, and transmitting cancer case information to state cancer registries, among others. We welcome comments on this approach, particularly with respect to the readiness of this standard to support public health reporting and any potential benefits or limitations to this approach that we should consider.</P>",
      "<P>The HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework has undergone a significant redesign during the development of the HL7® FHIR® Release 5 (R5) standard, including the use of “SubscriptionTopic” HL7 FHIR Resources that define the criteria for standardized subscription notifications. We have structured our proposals in § 170.315(j)(23) and (24) to best accommodate health IT developers and the industry's maturity so that API-based subscriptions can be more easily implemented in the current health IT landscape. While the HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework in HL7® FHIR® R5 is well developed, the health IT industry is largely using HL7® FHIR® Release 4, Version 4.0.1 (HL7® FHIR® R4), for HL7 FHIR standards-based exchange. Updating all the criteria in the Program to HL7® FHIR® R5 to accommodate the updated HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework would not be practicable nor prudent given the full-scale industry redesign that would be necessary to do so and impacts on users. In order to enable health IT developers using HL7® FHIR® R4, to support the improvements made in the HL7 FHIR Subscriptions Framework in HL7® FHIR® R5, the HL7 standards community created the Subscriptions R5 Backport Implementation Guide version 1.1.0, which specifies some of the HL7® FHIR® R5 Subscriptions Framework enhancements in a way that is compatible with HL7® FHIR® R4.</P>",

      "<P>\n                        In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized a “multi-factor authentication” (MFA) certification criterion in § 170.315(d)(13) and applied it to all certification criteria across the privacy &amp; security (P&amp;S) certification framework (85 FR 25700). Through this certification criterion and the P&amp;S Certification Framework, we established an approach that required health IT developers to be transparent about whether their certified Health IT Module supports MFA. As part of the certification process, developers' “yes” or “no” attestations are made public on ONC's Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) which is accessible here: \n                        <E T=\"03\">https://chpl.healthit.gov/.</E>\n                    </P>",

We therefore finalized our current approach to allow for developers to attest “no” as a certification option, and to promote increased transparency into these “no” attestations, we included a provision that permitted health IT developers attesting “no” to explain why their Health IT Module does not support MFA. Any optional explanations provided were also made available to the public on the CHPL as part of the certification process.</P>"

      "<P>\n                        We propose to update the requirements in the “Multi-factor authentication” certification criterion in § 170.315(d)(13) to increase support for MFA in certified health IT without imposing additional requirements on health care providers. We believe these updates match industry information security best practice for important authentication use cases in health IT and that it is necessary to help better protect electronic health information. We propose to expire our current “yes” or “no” attestation requirements by moving them to § 170.315(d)(13)(i) and including an applicability date for the time period up to and including December 31, 2027 in § 170.315(d)(13). We propose to replace the attestation requirements by revising § 170.315(d)(13) to include the new requirements in § 170.315(d)(13)(ii) that become required for continued conformance on and after January 1, 2028. We propose with these new requirements to require, in § 170.315(d)(13)(ii)(A), Health IT Module support for authentication, through multiple elements of the user's identity, according to industry recognized standards. Additionally, we propose, in § 170.315(d)(13)(ii)(B), to require that Health IT Modules certified to the criterion provide functionality that allows users (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         providers and patients) to configure, enable and disable these multi-factor authentication capabilities. Lastly, we propose that a health IT developer may meet the proposed revised certification criterion's requirements just by satisfying the new conformance requirements proposed in § 170.315(d)(13)(ii) in lieu of § 170.315(d)(13)(i) prior to paragraph (i)'s December 31, 2027, expiration.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We expect that Health IT Modules certifying to this MFA criterion must have the ability to authenticate users using multiple means to confirm that users are who they claim to be. Multiple means of authentication in this context includes using two or more of the following: (i) Something people know, such as a password or a personal identification number (PIN); (ii) something people have, such as a phone, badge, card, RSA token or access key; and (iii) something people are, such as fingerprints, retina scan, heartbeat, and other biometric information (85 FR 25701). Examples of industry recognized standards for MFA include NIST Special Publication 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, and ISO 27001.\n                        <SU>181</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         As we stated in 2019, when we first proposed MFA requirements in the Program, a government led initiative and numerous organizations and groups recommend the use of MFA (84 FR 7451). More recently, the HHS Office for Civil Rights has identified weakened healthcare authentication measures as one of the biggest causes of data breaches in recent years.\n                        <SU>182</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         We believe our proposal helps improve security by increasing access to MFA.

For example, the LRI and LOI implementation guides require ordering provider, patient address, patient phone number, and patient race. Further, the LRI IG aligns with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) requirements in place for laboratories. The update to these specifications, and the inclusion of the receipt of orders in § 170.315(f)(3), as well as the receipt of results in § 170.315(a)(2), ensure that functions throughout the lifecycle of the laboratory order, from entry, to result, to reporting to public health authority, is covered by electronic requirements with the associated national standard.</P>",

On and after January 1, 2028, for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(2), we propose that such Health IT Modules must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii).</P>",

      "<P>We propose to reorganize and rephrase the application registration requirements currently in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii). The current application registration requirements in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) require support for an application to register with the Health IT Module's “authorization server” to support retrieval of data for a single patient's data and multiple patients' data. No standard is currently specified for registration. We propose to rename § 170.315(g)(10)(i) as “Registration,” and move the existing application registration requirements from § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) to § 170.315(g)(10)(i). We also propose to clarify in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) which app types are currently required to be supported for functional registration (confidential and public apps). Clarifying these app types required for functional registration does not introduce new requirements since confidential and public apps were already required to be supported for functional registration according to the current requirements in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii). We note that we propose to no longer specifically reference the “confidential app” profile from the SMART App Launch implementation guide in the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion. Instead, we propose to refer to the app types of “confidential app” and “public app” as described in the section of this rule titled “SMART App Launch 2.2.” In addition to this move and clarification, we also propose that on and after January 1, 2028, both the capabilities proposed in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) and (B) would be required to support the full scope of API capabilities required in the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion. This includes as part of the regulation text reordering new proposed language in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) to reference § 170.315(j)(1) to support “functional registration” and new proposed language in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(B) to reference § 170.315(j)(2) to support “dynamic registration.” We clarify that the capability described at proposed § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) is not intended to substantively change the application registration requirements with which health IT developers are currently familiar, but instead clarify the nature of the functional requirements and detail which app types are required to be supported for functional registration (confidential and public apps). To accommodate the distinct proposal to require dynamic client registration as part of § 170.315(g)(10), the proposed § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(B) focuses on dynamic client registration for patient and user access as proposed in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii) and system access at (iii).</P>"

In addition to maintaining current requirements from § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) for authentication and authorization for patient and user scopes, the proposed references in the § 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion to § 170.315(j)(9) and (10) would also add requirements to support SMART App Launch capabilities for authentication and authorization for patient-facing apps and user-facing apps according to the implementation specification of SMART App Launch 2.2.0, proposed in this rule to be adopted in § 170.215(c)(3).

This is distinct from the existing patient authorization revocation requirement currently in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) and proposed in § 170.315(j)(6)(iii) which requires support for revocation of a patient's authorization but does not require support for revocation of a clinician's authorization.

      "<P>The proposed implementation specifications referenced in the proposed certification criteria in § 170.315(g)(30)-(36) include the required and recommended implementation specifications identified in CMS' finalized policies for payer API requirements (89 FR 8945). We propose to adopt current versions of the IGs that CMS recommended in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule and propose to require these IGs as part of the certification criteria proposed in § 170.315(g)(30)-(36). In the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule, CMS discussed its approach to recommending, rather than requiring, certain IGs for payer APIs. CMS stated that its goal in recommending the specific IGs for each API was to provide directional guidance to the industry without locking payers into the versions available at the time of the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization proposed rule, due to the maturity of the versions available at that time (89 FR 8921). CMS sought to ensure that payers could use subsequent versions of those IGs without being restricted to those versions. CMS further stated that it intended to monitor IG development and would consider proposing to require versions of these IGs in future rulemaking (89 FR 8937).</P>",
      "<P>We believe that proposing to adopt the current versions of the IGs recommended by CMS in the rulemaking described above is appropriate for the proposed certification criteria at this time. Adopting and specifying use of these IGs is necessary to ensure that Health IT Modules certified to the criteria proposed in this section are implemented consistently and enable interoperable exchange of information. We also note that adoption of these IGs would support CMS policies established in their Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule. Furthermore, if the adoption of these IGs is finalized, we would review and potentially approve future versions of these standards under the SVAP for voluntary use in the Program as they become available. The flexibility provided under the SVAP would ensure that developers are able to voluntarily update to later versions of these standards as future improvements are made, without waiting for updated versions to be proposed and finalized in regulation. In addition, we will continue to work with CMS to identify updated versions of these standards for potential future adoption in regulation at appropriate intervals so that the adopted versions of standards are the most up-to-date available and are feasible for real-world implementation.</P>",
      "<P>The proposed certification criteria in § 170.315(g)(30)-(36) also incorporate certification criteria for modular API capabilities proposed in § 170.315(j) in section III.B.17 of this proposed rule, including capabilities for registration (§ 170.315(j)(1)-(2)), authentication and authorization (§ 170.315(j)(5)-(7)), workflow triggers for decision support interventions (§ 170.315(j)(20)-(21)), and subscriptions (§ 170.315(j)(23)-(24)).</P>",
      "<P>Below, we describe each certification criterion and our intent to certify Health IT Modules to these certification criteria to support interoperability. However, we note that the certification of any Health IT Module by a health IT developer is voluntary. The proposals in this proposed rule would not establish requirements for health IT beyond those Health IT Modules submitted for certification for these criteria under the Program, nor does the availability of these certification criteria require any individual or entity to use certified health IT, including payers subject to the CMS requirements. Our goal in proposing these certification criteria and the related implementation specifications is to support health IT developers building these capabilities (and customers implementing them) in a manner that is consistent with nationally recognized standards and supports testing and conformance to these standards through the ONC Health IT Certification Program. ONC's adoption of certification criteria, standards, and implementation specifications are part of an effort to advance a set of minimum technical requirements, increase the availability of health IT leveraging such requirements, and provide the healthcare community with an improved, interoperable health IT infrastructure.</P>",
      "<P>We reiterate that, if finalized, certification to these criteria would be available for health IT developers (which may include payers and other developers providing technology to payers) seeking voluntary certification and any requirements for a certification criterion are only required in the sense that they are necessary to achieve certification. ONC does not establish requirements for whether and in what ways patients, health care providers, payers or others use health IT. Instead, we enable the certification of Health IT Modules that may support a wide range of users. In this way, the Program helps to advance standards for certified Health IT Modules and increases the availability of interoperable health IT across healthcare and health related use cases.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Finally, we note that CMS has not proposed to require that impacted payers subject to the API requirements in the CMS Patient Access and Interoperability and CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rules obtain or implement Health IT Modules certified to the criteria in this proposed rule. We also note that CMS has not identified health IT certified to the “prior authorization API—provider” criterion proposed below in § 170.315(g)(34) as necessary to complete the finalized electronic prior \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63582\"/>\n                        authorization measures in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the Promoting Interoperability performance category of MIPS. If this certification criterion is finalized, we would work with CMS on appropriate updates to the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the MIPS Promoting Interoperability performance category to identify health IT certified to this criterion as an element of CEHRT necessary to report on the electronic prior authorization measures. As CMS noted in the Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule, use of health IT certified to support electronic prior authorization transactions can help to ensure that the actions associated with these measures are executed in a consistent fashion across the health care providers participating in these programs (89 FR 8802).\n                    </P>"

We received a wide range of input on this topic with commenters noting that different types of systems, including EHRs, revenue cycle and patient management systems, and third-party applications may be responsible for different elements of the electronic prior authorization workflow. Some commenters recommended that ONC consider proposing individual criteria that map to each of the Da Vinci IGs (the CRD, DTR, and PAS IGs) which we discussed in the RFI and have proposed to adopt in this proposed rule.

Specifically, health IT developers are permitted to use “relied upon software” (76 FR 1276) to demonstrate compliance with certification criteria adopted at 45 CFR part 170, subpart C.\n                        <SU>206</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Relied upon software is typically third-party software that is not developed by the health IT developer presenting its health IT for testing and certification. Relied upon software may be used to demonstrate compliance with a portion of an adopted certification criterion or an entire certification criterion. When a health IT developer relies upon software to demonstrate compliance with a certification criterion, such relied upon software must be included in the scope of the certification issued to the Health IT Module or Complete EHR.

Afterwards, the Health IT Module developer is permitted to list all additional “relied upon software” products for the same capability paired with the certified Health IT Module without having to test each one with the ONC-ATL. A health IT developer always remains responsible for its product's conformance to a certification criterion even when the “relied upon software” contributes to, or is the cause of, a non-conformity.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>Given that we have proposed to adopt new certification criteria that would be applicable to certified API technology under the Program, we propose to extend the applicability of the API Conditions of Certification in § 170.404(a) and certain API Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.404(b) to Certified API Developers with Health IT Modules certified to the criteria proposed for adoption in § 170.315(g)(20), § 170.315(g)(30)-(36), and § 170.315(j). If our proposals are finalized, this would mean that the API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements would include within its scope the certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7)-(10), § 170.315(g)(20), § 170.315(g)(30)-(36), and § 170.315(j). We propose to make corresponding and conforming edits to § 170.404, including revisions to both § 170.404(a) and in § 170.404(b), to specify which API-related certification criteria apply in the context of each Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement. We believe this approach is essential to continue to fulfill the statutory requirements set forth in PHSA § 3001(c)(5)(D)(iv), in particular Congress' requirement that a developer of certified health IT has “published application programming interfaces and allows health information from such technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort.” As we described in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (84 FR 7476 through 7477), we established the API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements to, among other outcomes, promote transparency and pro-competitive business practices among Certified API Developers in pursuit of a policy that would result in access, exchange, and use of EHI “without special effort.” We believe that these same requirements should apply to developers of these new API-related certification criteria in § 170.315(g)(20) and (g)(30)-(36), and that the proposals to reference these certification criteria in § 170.404 would continue to adhere to our statutory charge to advance nationwide interoperability.</P>",

Correspondingly, we propose to remove those three specified “documentation” paragraphs from those respective certification criteria because the consolidated conformance requirements would now be stated in the proposed § 170.404(a)(2). We believe that these documentation requirements should also pertain to the other API-related criteria we propose to adopt in § 170.315(g)(20), (g)(30)-(36), and § 170.315(j), and we believe that such requirements better fit as a generally applicable API Condition of Certification requirement than a functional requirement specified in each individual API-related certification criterion.</P>",

In § 170.404(a)(2)(i), we propose that this should include technical documentation currently in § 170.315(g)(7), (9), and (10) such as API syntax, function names, required and optional parameters supported and their \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63593\"/>\n                        data types, return variables and their types/structures, exceptions and exception handling methods and their returns.

We propose that this process shall not apply to API Users that are part of a trust community supported at an API Information Source deployment submitting registration requests conformant to the specifications in § 170.215(o). In § 170.404(b)(1)(ii) we propose that a Certified API Developer must register and enable all applications for production use within five business days of completing its verification of an API User's authenticity, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

      "<P>We welcome comments on our proposal, and welcome comments on other alternatives that would offer a consistent approach for all health IT developers to report on the representativeness of the data provided to ONC. We continue to believe reporting the percentage of “clinicians” (for products primarily used in outpatient settings) and “hospitals” (for products primarily used in inpatient settings) in § 170.407(a)(1)(i)(C) is the best approach given that this aligns with CMS programs and is used to determine whether developers meet the threshold for reporting on the Insights Condition of Certification, however, we are open to considering alternatives that provide a consistent manner for developers to provide transparency on the degree to which the data are complete. This may also include removing the requirement for developers to provide the percentage of total customers that are represented in the data in § 170.407(a)(1)(i)(C), and instead only require developers to provide health care provider identifiers if that would provide a more consistent approach across developers and also allow us to gauge the representativeness of the data while reducing burden. We seek public feedback on approaches to understand the types and number of providers that are included in the data submitted, relative to the broader population of providers using the products of a developer of certified health IT.

We stated that developers of certified health IT who do not meet the minimum reporting qualifications would submit a response to specify that they do not meet the qualifications under the Insights Condition. In this way, all developers of certified health IT would report on all measures, even if some report that they do not meet the minimum reporting qualifications (89 FR 1345).</P>",

For example, a developer of certified health IT who is submitting their response July 2027, would include data from all their applicable certified health IT from the prior year between January to December 2026 for their July 2027 submission.

This is similar to real world testing reporting requirements which has a specified date for all developers of certified health IT to assess their eligibility on submitting a real world testing plan per § 170.405. We strongly encourage developers of certified health IT to assess whether they meet the minimum reporting qualifications for the Insights Condition on January 1st of each year beginning in 2026.

Many health IT developers update their certified Health IT Module(s) on a regular basis, leveraging the flexibility using Inherited Certified Status.

We also indicated that we intend to provide a method for health IT developers to first indicate whether they plan to share proprietary, trade secret, and/or confidential information for purposes of either required or optional documentation, and if a health IT developer provided an affirmative indication, ONC would engage the developer in dialogue about potential alternative means of meeting either required documentation requirements or providing optional documentation (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         in other generalized or descriptive ways that may achieve the same goal) (89 FR 1344 through 1345).\n                    </P>",

      "<P>\n                        As proposed above, the proposed “individuals' access to electronic health information through certified health IT” measure consists of three metrics, as specified in the measure specification sheet, one of which is the number of unique individuals who accessed their EHI using technology certified to the “standardized API for patient population services” under § 170.315(g)(10). As we stated in the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1313), the measure specification sheets provide granular definitions and other information needed to operationalize the metrics to ensure they are implemented in a consistent manner across health IT developers. In the measure specification sheet, we defined measuring access to EHI for this measure by counting an individual's authorization, as indicated by an access token, at least once during the reporting period.\n                        <SU>225</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         We intend to modify this definition in an updated version of the measure specification sheet as a technical update as it does not change the substance of this measure, since there may be instances where individuals authorize access to their data (via an access token) but no requests are made to retrieve the data. Given that our intent is to measure individuals' access to EHI (versus just authorizing access), we plan to update this definition in the measure specification sheet for this metric to further specify that access to EHI should be measured by counting the number of individuals where at least one FHIR resource was returned when using the “standardized API for patient population services” under § 170.315(g)(10) during the reporting period.\n                    </P>",

We acknowledge that there may be concerns related to defining in terms of FHIR requests as we may technically be including unauthorized requests as a measure of access to EHI.

We refer readers to the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1312) where we explained that while the substantive requirements for each measure are defined through rulemaking, we determined that measure specification sheets are a logical and accessible method for the public to view the technical specifications that support those requirements.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We stated in the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1322) that if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future—such as a revision to a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking—the measure specification would also be changed to ensure alignment with the revised criterion. Therefore, we expect to update the metrics for the proposed “C-CDA reconciliation and incorporation through certified health IT” measure, within the accompanying measure specification sheet to align with the proposed broader set of data referenced by the criterion specified in § 170.315(b)(2) if finalized as proposed. As stated above, the accompanying measure specification sheet reflecting the technical updates to align with the proposed broader set of data in this proposed rule will be available on ONC's website for review to support public comment in a transparent manner. Specifically, we intend to replace references in the measure specification sheet for problems, medications, and allergies and intolerances with a reference to the proposed data specified in § 170.315(b)(2) and, consistent with the policy established in the HTI-1 Final Rule (see 89 FR 1312), we intend to continue to align measure specification sheets with any modifications to certification criteria finalized via notice and comment rulemaking—in this instance, specifically for § 170.315(b)(2). The specific data classes and elements proposed in § 170.407(a)(3)(ii)(E), that we intend to list in the measurement specification sheet as technical updates, are selected from the additional data that would be included in proposed § 170.315(b)(2) listed below:</P>",
      "<P>• The data elements Substance (Medication) and Substance (Drug Class) in the Allergies and Intolerances data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data elements Patient Goals and SDOH Goals in the Goals data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Immunizations in the Immunizations data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Values/Results in the Laboratory data class</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Medications in the Medications data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Unique Device Identifier—Implantable for a patient's implantable device(s) in the Medical Devices data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Assessment and Plan of Treatment in the Assessment and Plan of Treatment data class.</P>",
      "<P>• The data element Problems and SDOH Problems/Health Concerns in the Problems data class.</P>",
      "<P>We would provide technical updates resulting in additional metrics in the accompanying measure specification sheet that capture (1) the number of specific data elements obtained in the reporting period, and (2) the reconciliation of specific data, such as the number of problems reconciled and incorporated by various means. Together, this data would allow ONC to calculate how often problems and other data elements are reconciled and incorporated by various means using the number of each data element obtained and other existing metrics (such as the number of encounters) as denominators. We request comment on whether that approach would provide beneficial information commensurate with the potential burden for developers.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Given the number of data elements that Health IT Modules certified to \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63599\"/>\n                        § 170.315(b)(2) would be able to reconcile and incorporate following the proposed revisions for the certification criteria, we have specified a limited set of Data Elements and Data Classes for which developers would count the number of Elements obtained and the number of Elements reconciled and incorporated for the Insights Condition in the measurement specification accompanying this proposed rule. We request comment on the specific Data Classes or Elements on which such metrics should focus. For instance, metrics specifically focused on reconciliation of medications may provide the most value in informing how often medication information is updated to accurately reflect care received from other organizations and allow for effective decision support; in contrast, metrics on reconciliation and incorporation of vital signs may provide relatively limited value.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We also request comment on whether metrics should focus on specific data elements or should aggregate data elements to the data class level. For example, it may be more valuable and feasible to include a metric on the aggregate total number of substance (Medication) and substance (Drug Class) data elements within the Allergies and Intolerances data class rather than two separate metrics, one focused on Substance (Medication) and another focused-on Substance (Drug Class). We request comment on the feasibility and value of separate metrics by Data Element and aggregate elements by some or all Data Elements within a Data Class, which may differ by specific Element and Class.</P>",
      "<P>We are also considering approaches to capture use of the proposed requirements for § 170.315(b)(2), if finalized as proposed, to support automatic reconciliation and incorporation in the accompanying measure specification sheet. As in prior versions of the measurement specification, the metric on the number of total C-CDAs obtained equals the sum of the metric on the number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed and the metric on the number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed. We clarify that all documents for which reconciliation and incorporation is completed through fully automated processes would be considered to have been pre-processed for the purpose of this metric.</P>",
      "<P>The measurement specification sheet further differentiates four metrics for pre-processed C-CDA documents: the first and second metrics respectively count pre-processed C-CDA documents that had data reconciled and incorporated via manual processes and fully automated processes, and the third and fourth metrics respectively count pre-processed C-CDA documents that were determined to have no data that modifies the patient record through manual processes and fully automated processes. These four metrics address pre-processed C-CDA documents that are manually acted upon or fully automated for reconciliation and incorporation but do not capture those C-CDAs that were obtained and pre-processed but not further acted upon by manual or fully automated processes.</P>",
      "<P>The metric on the number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed is further differentiated by two metrics: the first metric counts C-CDA documents that were not pre-processed that had data reconciled and incorporated via manual processes, and the second metric counts C-CDA documents that were not pre-processed that were determined to have no data that modifies the patient record through manual processes. These two metrics account for all C-CDAs that are obtained, not pre-processed, and are then acted upon and do not include those C-CDAs that are obtained, not pre-processed, and not acted upon. While these sets increase the number of metrics to report, we believe they will clarify and simplify measuring and categorizing C-CDA documents.</P>",
      "<P>In the HTI-1 Final Rule, we defined “Reconciled and Incorporated via Any Method” to be an approach to reconciling and incorporating information in the Health IT Module, including but not limited to, manual processes performed by a clinician or their delegate only; a mix of manual and automated processes; or fully automated processes (89 FR 1319). Given the focus on automatic reconciliation and incorporation capabilities in this proposed rule for § 170.315(b)(2), we anticipate aligning the measure specification sheet by dividing the metrics that call for reporting on the total number of C-CDA documents that were reconciled and incorporated by “any method” into two categories: (1) C-CDA documents where data were reconciled and incorporated via manual processes performed by a clinician or their delegate only; and (2) a C-CDA documents where any data was reconciled and incorporated via fully automated processes. These additional metrics are intended to generate insight into the use of automatic capabilities and how often C-CDAs are reconciled and incorporated by fully automatic means.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We have chosen these two categories to capture instances where the reconciliation and incorporation process is at least partly completed by automated means and because we believe that instances in which \n                        <E T=\"03\">all</E>\n                         data contained in a C-CDA are reconciled and incorporated via fully automated processes will be rare given the scope of data proposed to be included in the proposed § 170.315(b)(2). Alternatively, we could include an additional metric in the measure specification sheet to capture documents in which data is reconciled and incorporated through a mix of manual and automated processes, which would occur, for example, when problems were reconciled by automated processes and medications were reconciled by manual processes.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We also intend to complement the existing metric focused on C-CDA documents that were determined to have no new information by pre-processes or fully automated processes with an additional metric. The additional metric would capture the number of C-CDA documents that were determined to have no new information by manual processes performed by a clinician or their delegate only. These two metrics focused on determining that there was no new information would therefore directly mirror the two metrics focused on reconciliation and incorporation following pre-processes. In revising these metrics, we are also considering alternatives that would describe the varied ways in which data contained within C-CDAs could lead to modification or reconciliation with the patients record. We request comment on whether metrics in the updated measure specification sheet that include the term 'no new data' clearly exclude instances where information in C-CDAs lead to a change to the patient's record. For example, if information in the patient record is deleted or modified in response to information in the C-CDA, the intention is that this be counted as an instance where information is reconciled and incorporated (either via manual or automated processes) and NOT as an instance where documents were determined to have no new data. If the current metrics are not clear, would it be more effective to revise the metrics on “no new data” as listed below:</P>",
      "<P>• Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed and determined to have no data specified in § 170.315(b)(2) that modifies the patient record by manual processes performed by a clinician or their delegate.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        • Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed and \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63600\"/>\n                        determined to have no data specified in § 170.315(b)(2) that modifies the patient record by pre-processes or fully automated processes.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>• Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed and determined to have no new data specified in § 170.315(b)(2) that modifies the patient record via manual processes performed by a clinician or their delegate only.</P>",
      "<P>As noted earlier, please see the measure specification sheet that will be posted on ONC's website for review.</P>",
      "<P>We request public comment on the definitions provided in that measure specification sheet for manual processes, and fully automated process as well as the feasibility of separately measuring those processes. We also request comment on whether the resulting separate metrics would effectively capture the use of the proposed new capabilities to automatically reconcile and incorporate information for § 170.315(b)(2), and request comment on the value of including a metric capturing when a “mix” of automated and manual processes were used to reconcile and incorporate data.</P>",
      "<P>We also plan to make a technical update by revising the number of unique patients with an associated C-CDA document measure to instead capture the number of unique patients with an encounter and associated C-CDA document. The revised metric would be a direct subset of the existing metric Number of Unique Patients with an Encounter. The current metric comprehensively captures the number of patients with C-CDAs but may include some C-CDAs for patients who are not treated by a provider using the product during the reporting period. We do not anticipate any change in burden, and are requesting comment on the relative value of the altered metric.</P>",
      "<P>In the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1326), we finalized the “use of FHIR in apps through certified health IT” in § 170.407(a)(3)(iv). This measure captures the volume and type of FHIR resources transferred to apps from certified health IT relative to the number of active certified API technology deployments. We intend to make a technical update in the accompanying measure specification sheet to provide additional implementation information specifying that reporting by user type should be done according to three mutually exclusive categories: patient-facing only, non-patient facing only, and both patient-facing and non-patient facing.</P>",
      "<P>In the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1332), we finalized the “immunization administrations electronically submitted to immunization information systems through certified health IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(3)(vi). We stated that this measure would report on the volume of immunization administrations electronically submitted to an immunization information system through certified health IT. In the accompanying measure specification sheet, we indicated that the number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted successfully to IISs overall was defined as the total number of messages submitted to IISs, minus acknowledgements with the error of severity level E. We intend to make a few technical updates to this measure specification sheet. First, we intend to add metrics to separately count the number of immunizations administered electronically submitted to IISs that returned with an acknowledgement with the error of severity level E during the reporting period overall, and by IIS and age category. These additional metrics would enable us to identify potential issues associated with submissions to the IIS. We do not expect any additional burden associated with reporting this metric. We also request comment on the value and burden associated if we have the metrics count the immunizations administered electronically returned by their acknowledgement code (by IIS and age) instead, which would allow us to understand the number of messages that were rejected, had errors, and were accepted by IIS and age.</P>",
      "<P>We also intend to make another technical update to the measure specification sheet by adding metrics to separately count the number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted to IIS where an acknowledgement from an IIS is not received by certified health IT overall, and by IIS and age category. The current measure specification sheet indicates health IT developers optionally report on number of submissions that did not receive acknowledgement as part of the supplemental documentation. These separate metrics would enable monitoring the occurrence of these communication failures between certified health IT and IIS more systematically. We do not expect substantive additional burden associated with this metric. We also request comment on the value and burden associated with reporting a count of the subset of messages sent to third party intermediaries where the third-party intermediary does not provide an acknowledgement that the message was sent to an IIS. Finally, we intend to make a technical update that would clarify that the immunization administration submitted would include HL7 Z22 messages, and request comment on this approach. This aligns with the “immunization history and forecasts through certified health IT” measure specification sheet where we indicate that “the successful response received from IIS” include HL7 Z42 and Z32 messages.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1336), we finalized the “immunization history and forecasts through certified health IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(3)(vii). This measure captures the use of certified health IT to query information from an IIS under the “transmission to immunization registries” (§ 170.315(f)(1)) criterion. In the accompanying measure specification sheet, we indicated that the number of immunization queries sent to IISs overall metric would be defined as the total number of messages sent to IISs, minus acknowledgements with errors (severity level E). We intend to make a technical update and modify this definition in the measure specification sheet as it does not change the substance of this measure. We plan to update this definition so that the number of immunization queries sent to IISs overall metric should be measured by only counting the total number of immunization queries sent to IISs during the reporting period. This metric no longer requires subtracting the number of acknowledgements with the error of severity level E. Instead, we are adding separate metrics in the measure specification sheet which would report on the total number of queries responses that returned with acknowledgements that had an error of severity level E, overall and by IIS, during the reporting period. This would enable us to understand how many queries were rejected by an IIS (as indicated by an “E” code) during the reporting period. We do not expect any additional burden associated with metric. We also plan to make a technical update to the definition of “queries sent” to IISs such that the definition of queries sent applies to HL7 Z34 and HL7 Z44 messages. This approach would provide consistency in how queries sent are defined across developers. Additionally, it would align the definition of “queries sent” with “successful response received from IIS,” which is based upon the receipt of HL7 Z42 and Z32 messages. We also request comment on the value and burden associated if we have the metrics count the query responses returned by their acknowledgement code (by IIS) instead, \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63601\"/>\n                        which would allow us to understand the number of queries sent where data was found, no data was found, or multiple candidates exist, or where query messages that were rejected, had errors, and were accepted by IIS.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1338) we also received a couple comments noting that a significant portion of messaging failures are communication failures where there will be no response received. A commenter suggested that messages with no response from the IIS (in the case of downtime, for example) would be considered successful (89 FR 1338). In response, we stated that at this time, we will not require health IT developers to provide separate counts for communication failures and counts of the descriptive context levels, and encouraged developers capture information about communication failures as their functionality permits and include this explanation in the supplemental documentation. We also stated that we would collaborate with the community to monitor how these instances impact the measure's interpretation and determine if it should be revised in the future.</P>",
      "<P>Given the potential value of understanding the frequency of these communication failures, we plan to make a technical update in the accompanying measure specification sheet to create additional metrics which would report on the total number of queries sent but where no acknowledgement was received from the IIS overall, and by IIS. The separate metric to count no acknowledgements would allow us and the CDC to monitor the occurrence of these communication failures between certified health IT and IIS rather than relying on supplemental reporting to gather this information. We do not expect substantive additional burden associated with this metric. We also request comment on the value and burden associated with reporting a count of the queries sent to third party intermediaries where the third-party intermediary does not provide an acknowledgement the query was sent onto an IIS.</P>"

In the HTI-1 Final Rule, we narrowed the overall scope of technologies impacted by finalized requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) (89 FR 1251 through 1252). We finalized minimal, uniform requirements for all Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) while also maintaining a construction that enables a developer of certified health IT to certify a Health IT Module to § 170.315(b)(11) without being obligated to author, develop, or otherwise directly provide Predictive DSIs to its customers. Specifically, we finalized a configuration nexus for several requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) that centered on whether the developer of certified health IT supplied a Predictive DSI as part of its Health IT Module.</P>",
      "<P>We also finalized in the HTI-1 Final Rule a supportive Maintenance of Certification requirement as part of the Assurances Condition of Certification in § 170.402(b) for § 170.315(b)(11).

Specifically, we asked whether certain types of notices under direct review should be considered more critical than others and, thus, might require a specific method of correspondence (84 FR 7504). In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized the proposal to use the provisions in § 170.505 for correspondence regarding compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements with minor revisions outlining specific considerations for when we would provide notice beyond email (85 FR 25784).\n                    </P>",

In § 170.505(a)(2)(i), where we receive a communication from the ONC-ACB, ONC-ATL, applicant, developer, or other party in response to a written correspondence, we believe that response is sufficient to demonstrate the communication has been received. Similarly, in § 170.505(a)(2)(ii) a delivery confirmation date, such as from the United States Postal Service (USPS) for certified mail, that is fewer than seven business days after the communication was sent would be considered the day the communication was received.</P>",

      "<P>To better support health IT developers' ability to consistently meet their obligations under subpart D of 45 CFR part 170, we propose to adopt new requirements in § 170.523 principles of proper conduct (PoPCs) for ONC-ACBs and new procedures for in-the-field surveillance of the maintenance of certification for Health IT in § 170.556 that would build on ONC-ACBs' existing surveillance responsibilities and obligations. More specifically, we propose to adopt new surveillance reporting requirements in § 170.523(i), reporting for corrective action plan (CAP) non-compliance in § 170.523(x), new oversight responsibilities of certain Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.523(p) and (q), new and revised surveillance requirements in § 170.556(b), and new and revised procedures for CAPs in § 170.556(d).</P>",
      "<P>We believe these proposed new and revised surveillance and PoPC requirements would promote Program efficiency and encourage Program-participating developers to maintain, or when necessary, regain, conformity with Program requirements for the applicable Maintenance of Certification requirements as required by the Program regulations promulgated under the Cures Act. Section 4002(a) of the Cures Act amended section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA by adding paragraph (c)(5)(D), which requires the Secretary, through notice and comment rulemaking, to require certain conditions of certification and maintenance of certification for the Program. In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we established Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements pursuant to PHSA 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) through (vi) in subpart D of 45 CFR part 170 (85 FR 25783). In the HTI-1 Final Rule, we established the Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (§ 170.407) pursuant to PHSA 3001(c)(5)(D)(vii) and the Assurances Maintenance of Certification requirement for health IT developers to update and provide their Health IT Modules (§ 170.402(b)(3). We also established in § 170.402(b)(4) an Assurances Maintenance of Certification requirement for Predictive Decision Support Intervention transparency (89 FR 1371), and in section III.C.2 of this proposed rule, we propose to establish a conforming update to the Attestation Condition and Maintenance of Certification in § 170.406(a)(2) to address the adopted § 170.402(b)(4) DSI Maintenance of Certification requirement.</P>",
      "<P>In addition to the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule we established that ONC would enforce compliance with the 45 CFR subpart D Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (85 FR 25783). However, we also established ONC-ACB responsibilities (PoPCs). These responsibilities included the review and approval for submission of developers' § 170.406 attestations (§ 170.523(q)) and § 170.405 real world testing plans and results (§ 170.523(p)) (85 FR 25951). The ONC Cures Act Final Rule also established a PoPC in § 170.523(s) requiring ONC-ACBs to report any information that could inform whether ONC should exercise direct review of noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements to ONC (85 FR 25783).</P>",
      "<P>ONC-ACBs' PoPC responsibilities under the currently codified requirements in § 170.523(p) have encouraged and helped Program-participating developers to achieve a high rate of compliance with the real world testing Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.405. Under § 170.523(p), ONC-ACBs are required to confirm the completeness of developers' real world testing plans and results, and to confirm the developer timely submitted materials for public availability in accordance with § 170.405(b). We believe a similarly supportive dynamic exists for developers' compliance with attestations requirements in § 170.406 and insights reporting requirements in § 170.407, for which ONC-ACBs have explicitly aligned PoPC responsibilities as described in § 170.523(q) and (u).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Informed by our experience with ONC-ACB support in monitoring and encouraging developers' compliance with certain 45 CFR 170 subpart D requirements over the past three years, and pursuant to the authority in PHSA \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63603\"/>\n                        section 3001(c)(5)(E) to “encourage compliance with the conditions of certification,” we now propose new ONC-ACB PoPC requirements in § 170.523 to encourage and support developers' compliance with Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.402 and 170.404. In parallel, we propose to update ONC-ACBs' responsibilities for conducting reactive surveillance in accordance with § 170.556(b) and working with developers to encourage remediation of observed non-conformities with Program requirements in § 170.556(d).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Our proposal in § 170.556(b) would require ONC-ACBs to initiate surveillance when they become aware of facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to question whether a health IT developer has satisfied certain Maintenance of Certification requirements. As a result of our proposals in § 170.556(b) and additional proposals in § 170.523(i), we are proposing to require ONC-ACBs perform reactive and randomized surveillance based on the specified Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(1)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b). In case of non-conformities, we would require an ONC-ACB to notify health IT developers and require a CAP, in addition to the existing requirements in § 170.556 consistent with their accreditation under PoPCs in § 170.523(a) and ISO/IEC 17065. In § 170.556(d), we further propose revisions to the required elements of a CAP for identified non-conformities with respect to Program requirements codified in subpart D for which we propose an ONC-ACB would have responsibility under § 170.523. Under these proposals in § 170.523 and § 170.556, an ONC-ACB would have the duty to confirm a health IT developer's compliance with, and initiate surveillance whenever it becomes aware of each non-conformity to, the Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(1)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b).</P>"

      "<P>In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we adopted Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health IT developers outlined in section 4002 of the Cures Act (85 FR 25717) and implemented them with further specificity in the Program, expressing initial and ongoing certification requirements for the health IT developers and their certified health IT products (85 FR 25718). We adopted certain responsibilities for the ONC-ACB's to ensure developers have met their obligations for certain Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. We also provided that, if the monitoring processes implemented by ONC-ACBs are not adhered to by developers, the ONC-ACB, in accordance with Program reporting requirements, should follow its processes to institute a CAP. Should the developer fail to engage in the CAP process the ONC-ACB would alert ONC of the developer's failure to comply with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements (85 FR 25720 through 25721).</P>",
      "<P>To ensure developers of health IT were meeting the requirements of the Program, we adopted requirements for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523. Specifically, we adopted PoPCs for ONC-ACBs in §§ 170.523(m), 170.523(p), 170.523(q), and 170.523(t) that aligned with certain Maintenance of Certification requirements, tasking ONC-ACBs to review and confirm certain information is submitted by health IT developers in response to the real world testing and attestation Maintenance of Certification requirements. ONC-ACBs are required to share additional information, as it relates to certain Maintenance of Certification requirements, with the National Coordinator regarding developer compliance with Program requirements (85 FR 25784 through 25785).</P>",
      "<P>We now propose to expand an ONC-ACB's responsibilities to require additional oversight of certain Maintenance of Certification requirements be included in the ONC-ABC's surveillance reports and to provide certain documentation to the National Coordinator as part of its surveillance. We propose new PoPC requirements for ONC-ACBs specifically aligned to encourage transparency and support developers' compliance with Maintenance of Certification Requirements in 45 CFR part 170 subpart D, including redesignating § 170.523(p) through (u) as paragraphs (r) through (w). We propose to revise § 170.523(p) to add new requirements that ONC-ACBs verify and confirm a health IT developer's compliance with Attestation Maintenance of Certification requirements in accordance with § 170.402(b), and revise § 170.523(q) to add oversight requirements for developer compliance with API Maintenance of Certification requirements in accordance with § 170.404(b). Our proposed redesignation would mean the current requirements in § 170.523(p) real world testing, § 170.523(q) attestations, § 170.523(r) test results from ONC-ATLs, § 170.523(s) information for direct review, § 170.523(t) Health IT Module voluntary standards and implementation specifications updates notices, and § 170.523(u) insights would be shifted to § 170.523(r), (s), (t), (u), (v), and (w), respectively. We note that we do not propose to revise the requirements in proposed § 170.523(r), (s), (t), (u), (v) or (w) (currently codified as § 170.523(p), (q), (r), (s), (t), and (u), respectively).</P>",
      "<P>Under these proposals in § 170.523, we would require that an ONC-ACB confirm and verify a health IT developer's compliance with the requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(1)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b) and, where a non-conformity rather than compliance is observed, to initiate surveillance in accordance with our proposals in § 170.556 (discussed in III.D.2.c below) and notify the health IT developer of each observed non-conformity. Each proposal in § 170.523(p) references a corresponding requirement for health IT developers in § 170.402(b), so that requirements in § 170.523(p)(1) references § 170.402(b)(1), our proposal for § 170.523(p)(2) references § 170.402(b)(2) and (b)(3), and our proposal for § 170.523(p)(3) references § 170.402(b)(4). Health IT developer requirements in § 170.404(b)(1) and (2) are also incorporated into our proposals for APIs in § 170.523(q). Similarly, the insights requirement in § 170.523(w) (finalized in the HTI-1 Final Rule as § 170.523(u) (89 FR 1435)) for ONC-ACBs was proposed and finalized simultaneously with corresponding developer requirements for Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.407.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose to limit the ONC-ACB oversight requirements to those certain Maintenance of Certification requirements mentioned above because of the administrative nature of these requirements (comparative to requiring, for example, investigation, analysis, or assessment). As stated above, ONC-ACBs already have responsibilities in § 170.523(p), (q), and (u) (which we propose to shift to § 170.523(r), (s), and (t), respectively) to verify and confirm that developers are meeting their obligations in §§ 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406, and 170.407. These Maintenance of Certification requirements require developers to submit documentation to ONC-ACBs, notify ONC-ACBs when a non-\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63604\"/>\n                        conformity arises during real world testing, and provide an attestation for compliance with certain certification criteria under the Program. We consider these obligations as strictly administrative, and their successful completion does not implicate developer behaviors that rise to the level of oversight that would be necessary for initial ONC review. Likewise, we consider the Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(1)-(4) and 170.404(b)(1) and (2) to also be administrative in nature. We believe the proposed addition of § 170.402(b)(1)-(4) in § 170.523(p)(1)-(3) and § 170.404(b)(1) and (2) in § 170.523(q)(1) and (2) is suitable considering the ONC-ACBs experience with confirming and verifying that a developer has met the requirements in §§ 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406, and 170.407.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We note that we do not propose to include in § 170.523 the oversight of a health IT developer's compliance with the requirements in § 170.401, Information Blocking, and § 170.403(b), Communications Maintenance of Certification requirements. Unlike the requirements in § 170.402(b)(1)-(4) and § 170.404(b)(1) and (2), which we consider administrative, the oversight and enforcement of Information Blocking addresses practices that interfere with the access, exchange or use of EHI, and the Communications Maintenance of Certification requirements focuses on the update of agreements with clients that could limit ongoing collaboration and coordination. These Maintenance of Certification requirements compel developers to design, implement, and maintain business practices that align with ONC standards, facilitate data exchange, and actively engage in practices that ensure that their products remain compliant. Centralizing the oversight of these Maintenance of Certification requirements under ONC removes the possibility of having these conflicts, ensuring a standardized and consistent approach to enforcing these requirements.</P>",
      "<P>While we consider the ONC-ACBs' Maintenance of Certification responsibilities as administrative, we also believe transparency is important regarding all Program requirements and propose to revise and add new PoPC surveillance reporting requirements for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523(i). As discussed, in § 170.556(b) and (d) we propose to add the Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed in § 170.523 to the ONC-ACBs' surveillance responsibilities. We propose that this responsibility would include initiating surveillance (§ 170.556(b)(2) and (3)), initiating CAP procedures (§ 170.556(d)(1)), initiating suspensions (§ 170.556(d)(5)) when a developer fails to engage with the CAP process for Maintenance of Certification non-conformities, and withdrawals (§ 170.556(d)(6)) when the health IT developer does not complete the actions necessary to reinstate the suspended certification (we refer readers to section III.D.2.c below for a discussion of these proposals). To better achieve transparency of the proposed surveillance activities, we propose to revise § 170.523(i)(2)(iii) to require ONC-ACBs, when conducting surveillance of certified health IT in accordance with their accreditation, to include the Maintenance of Certification requirements it surveilled in its quarterly surveillance results report.</P>",
      "<P>We also propose to add a requirement in § 170.523(i)(4) that an ONC-ACB, as part of its responsibilities to conduct surveillance of certified health IT in accordance with its accreditation, and proposed requirements in § 170.556, shall notify the National Coordinator prior to initiating the suspension or withdrawal of a certification as specified in § 170.556 for a non-conformity pertaining to a Maintenance of Certification requirement for which the ONC-ACBs have responsibilities. We propose this revision because, as a common practice, ONC-ACBs notify ONC before suspending a certification for a certified Health IT Module when a developer fails to engage with the CAP process pertaining to a certification requirement non-conformity, and before withdrawing a certified Health IT Module when the health IT developer has not completed the actions necessary to reinstate the suspended certification. We propose to explicitly codify this practice for enforcement activities pertaining to certain Maintenance of Certification non-conformities.</P>",
      "<P>To further our stated goals of increased transparency in the Program and encourage developer compliance, we also propose to add a new PoPC in § 170.523(x) “Reporting for non-compliance with approved corrective action plans.” We propose to require that ONC-ACBs report to ONC, pursuant to our proposal in § 170.556(d)(7)(ii), (discussed in detail in section III.D.2.c.iv below), the developer's failure to timely complete a CAP specific to a Maintenance of Certification requirement for which an ONC-ACB has specific responsibilities under § 170.523. We propose to require the ONC-ACBs to include all documentation pertaining to the identified non-conformity, including but not limited to the following information: (1) the Health IT Module and associated product(s); (2) the nature of the non-conformity(ies); (3) the corrective action plan documentation; (4) communications and records of proceedings; and (5) any additional information requested by ONC.</P>",
      "<P>We believe the proposed required documentation in § 170.523(x) is necessary and valuable to support the National Coordinator's review of a health IT developer's actions or practices without requiring ONC to engage in duplicative fact-finding processes for applicable cases of non-conformities. The proposed documentation in § 170.523(x) would also inform the National Coordinator on whether the ONC-ACB met their obligations to notify the developer of the non-conformity and initiate corrective action procedures under §§ 170.523 and 170.556. Furthermore, requiring the proposed stated documentation would provide clarity and consistency for developers of health IT and ONC-ACBs on our expectations for the degree of accuracy and detail required for documenting a non-conformity with a Maintenance of Certification requirement for which an ONC-ACB has specific responsibilities under § 170.523. The documentation requirements would also help construct an accurate record that could inform whether the National Coordinator should exercise direct review under § 170.580(a).</P>",
      "<P>Lastly, in § 170.523(i)(1), as part of an ONC-ACBs obligations to conduct surveillance of certified health IT in accordance with its accreditation and § 170.556, ONC requires ONC-ACBs to submit an annual surveillance plan to the National Coordinator. The ONC-ACBs submit their annual plans in September with an effective date of January 1 in the following year. As such, if we adopt the Maintenance of Certification requirements proposals in §§ 170.523 and 170.556, ONC-ACBs would need to include them as part of their annual surveillance plans for January 1, 2026.</P>",

      "<P>\n                        In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, we finalized that CAP requirements applied across-the-board to all types of surveillance and confirmed non-conformities (80 FR 62714). We reiterated that our goal for surveillance requirements was to ensure that health IT users, implementers, and purchasers \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63605\"/>\n                        would be alerted to potential non-conformities in a timely and effective manner, consistent with the patient safety, program integrity, and transparency objectives described in the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule (80 FR 62716 through 62717). We received support from commenters to specify certain required elements and procedures for CAPs (80 FR 62716). We also finalized reporting requirements for CAPs and extended these requirements to all cases in which an ONC-ACB confirms a non-conformity and subsequently approves a CAP (80 FR 62717).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We continued to build upon surveillance and CAP requirements by adopting the ONC direct review regulatory framework in the EOA Final Rule (81 FR 72468 through 72471), which permits the Program to provide enhanced oversight for safety and health IT developer accountability. The EOA Final Rule emphasized the importance of protecting public health and safety while also strengthening transparency and accountability in the Program. Following the EOA Final Rule, in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule we addressed enforcement processes for new requirements established in the Cures Act. Section 4002(a) of the Cures Act adds (in section 3001(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA) Program requirements aimed at addressing health IT developers' actions and business practices through the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, which expanded the focus of the Program requirements beyond the certified health IT itself (85 FR 25648 through 25649). Equally important, section 4002(a) of the Cures Act also provides (in section 3001(c)(5)(E) of the PHSA) that the Secretary may encourage compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance. In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we, therefore, finalized an enforcement framework for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 to encourage consistent compliance with the requirements. More specifically, we finalized processes in § 170.580 for ONC to review potential or known instances where a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement under the Program has not been met or is not being met by a health IT developer. We also finalized in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 requirements to utilize the processes previously established for ONC direct review of certified health IT in the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We noted that the new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in section 4002 of the Cures Act focus on the actions and business practices of health IT developers (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         information blocking and appropriate access, use, and exchange of electronic health information) as well as technical interoperability of health IT (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         APIs and real world testing) (85 FR 25782 through 25783). When we originally distinguished between the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements that focus on actions and business practices of health IT developers versus technical interoperability of health IT, we did not further distinguish exclusively administrative functions that are required of a health IT developer to meet certain Maintenance of Certification requirements in part 170 subpart D. Rather, we determined that ONC should be responsible for addressing non-conformities pertaining to all Maintenance of Certification requirements (85 FR 25782 through 25783). We also clarified that ONC-ACBs are not responsible for enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, and that they must report any information that could inform whether ONC should exercise direct review of noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements to ONC. We noted that ONC-ACBs also address non-conformities with technical and other Program requirements through surveillance and by working with health IT developers through CAPs. We stressed that, as finalized in the EOA Final Rule (81 FR 72427 through 72428) and per § 170.580(a)(3)(v), ONC may refer the applicable part of its review of certified health IT to the relevant ONC-ACB(s) if ONC determines this would serve the effective administration or oversight of the Program (85 FR 25785).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Since publication of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we now have enforcement experience with Maintenance of Certification requirements in 45 CFR 170 subpart D. More specifically, ONC conducted 13 direct reviews in 2023, of which 10 were in connection to the non-conformity to the API Maintenance of Certification requirement in § 170.404(b)(3) for failure to comply with the rollout of § 170.315(g)(10); two for failure to submit their real world testing results leading to a non-conformance with § 170.406(b)(2); and, one for failure to submit their annual attestation related to § 170.406(b). We have conducted multiple direct reviews of non-conformities specific to developers of certified health IT missing a document-submission or other deadline for Maintenance of Certification requirements in 45 CFR 170 subpart D. During these direct reviews, we have coordinated with the ONC-ACBs the corrective actions and communications with the developers. Based on this enforcement experience, we have found that some non-conformities specific to certain Maintenance of Certification requirements may be better and more quickly resolved without immediate ONC involvement in certain cases and are better suited to initial oversight by the ONC-ACBs.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        With this experience, we recognize that ONC-ACBs are equally well suited to conduct surveillance and work with developers of certified health IT through CAPs to remedy non-conformities beyond certification requirements in \n                        <E T=\"03\">certain circumstances.</E>\n                         We no longer believe that keeping enforcement for certain Maintenance of Certification requirements exclusively within ONC oversight benefits the Program and could, in fact, result in Program inefficiencies to the detriment of the Program, users of certified health IT, and developers of certified health IT. The inclusion of certain Maintenance of Certification requirements within ONC-ACB oversight would increase transparency and result in more expedient determinations of whether a non-conformity exists, along with its resolution. In our experience, the collaboration between ONC-ACBs, health IT developers of certified health IT, and users in examining potential non-conformities, along with ONC-ACB's oversight of specific Maintenance of Certification requirements, facilitates quicker resolutions leading to more efficiency in the Program. This efficiency stems from the ONC-ACBs' capacity to engage and communicate with developers promptly as well as their extensive expertise in surveilling certified Health IT Modules for continued conformity to the requirements of their certifications.\n                    </P>"

We propose in § 170.556(b) to require an ONC-ACB to initiate surveillance (including, as necessary, in-the-field \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63606\"/>\n                        surveillance required by paragraph (a) of this section) whenever it becomes aware of facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person in the ONC-ACB's position to question one or more of the following: (1) a certified Health IT Module's continued conformity to the requirements of its certification; (2) a developer's satisfaction of the Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.402(b)(1); and (3) an applicable developer's satisfaction of the Maintenance of Certification requirements for which an ONC-ACB has a responsibility under § 170.523 to confirm compliance.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We propose the surveillance requirements for the Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.556(b)(2) and (3) as two distinct elements because of the diverse obligations in 45 CFR part 170 subpart D that health IT developers must satisfy to remain in compliance with the Program. To ensure health IT developer accountability, and as discussed above, we have adopted the Maintenance of Certification requirements in part 170 subpart D to express ongoing requirements for health IT developers and their applicable Health IT Module(s) certified to specific certification criteria. The Maintenance of Certification requirements in 45 CFR part 170 subpart D do not always apply to all health IT developers participating in the Program. The Program is voluntary and health IT developers may certify their Health IT Module(s) to one, some, or all the certification criteria adopted by the Secretary, and they are not required to certify their Health IT Module(s) to every certification criterion to participate in the Program. Also as discussed in the previous section, we propose in § 170.523(p)(1) that ONC-ACBs confirm that health IT developers retain all records and information necessary to demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance with the requirements of the Program in accordance with § 170.402(b)(1). Our proposal in § 170.523(p)(1) would require ONC-ACBs to confirm that health IT developers are meeting the requirements in § 170.402(b)(1) and, in the proposed § 170.523(i)(2)(iii), we would require the ONC-ACBs to conduct surveillance of the Maintenance of Certification requirements and include the results in its quarterly report to the National Coordinator, in accordance with its accreditation and § 170.556(a) and (e)(1). To support the PoPC proposals in § 170.523, our proposal in § 170.556(b)(2) would require an ONC-ACB to initiate surveillance (including, as necessary, in-the-field surveillance) whenever it becomes aware of facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person in the ONC-ACB's position to question a developer's satisfaction of the Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.402(b)(1). The proposed requirements in § 170.523(i)(2)(iii) and in § 170.523(p)(1), taken together with our proposal in § 170.556(b)(2), would result in the ONC-ACB initiating and conducting surveillance of a health IT developers' satisfaction of its obligations in § 170.402(b)(1).</P>",
      "<P>Similar to our proposal in § 170.523(p)(1), we propose in § 170.523(p)(2) and (3), 170.523(q), (r), (s), and (w) to require the ONC-ACBs to confirm health IT developers are meeting their obligations, as applicable, under the Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(2)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b); and in § 170.523(i)(2)(iii) to conduct surveillance of the Maintenance of Certification requirements listed in § 170.523, in accordance with their accreditation and § 170.556(b)(3). To help meet these obligations, for the proposed requirement in § 170.556(b)(3), we propose to require an ONC-ACB to initiate surveillance (including, as necessary, in-the-field surveillance) when it becomes aware of facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person in its position to question an applicable developer's satisfaction of the Maintenance of Certification requirements for which an ONC-ACB has a responsibility under § 170.523 (that is, §§ 170.402(b)(2)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b)).</P>",
      "<P>Overall, the proposals in § 170.556(b)(2) and (3) would mean that as part of the requirement to confirm a health IT developer met its obligation(s) in part 170 subpart D, an ONC-ACB must initiate surveillance when it reasonably finds a health IT developer failed to meet the Maintenance of Certification subpart D requirements for which the ONC-ACB would have oversight of in § 170.523. We propose to distinguish between the proposed requirements in § 170.556(b)(2) and (3) because all health IT developers participating in the Program are required to comply with requirements in § 170.402(b)(1), whereas only health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to those certification criteria listed in the requirements in §§ 170.402(b)(2)-(4), 170.404(b)(1) and (2), 170.405(b)(1) and (2), 170.406(b), and 170.407(b) are required to comply with the applicable Maintenance of Certification requirements. Given these considerations and our proposal to expand ONC-ACB oversight of specific Maintenance of Certification requirements listed in § 170.523, we propose to include requirements that ONC-ACBs must initiate surveillance of the specified Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.556(b)(2) and (3) reactive surveillance whenever it becomes aware of facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person in the ONC-ACB's position to question a developer's satisfaction of its obligations under 45 CFR part 170 subpart D.</P>",
      "<P>Additionally, we propose to revise § 170.556(b)(1) by moving the current verification requirements of § 170.523(k) listed in § 170.556(b)(1) to be part of § 170.556(b)'s overall language. Our proposal would not change or modify the ONC-ACBs' current responsibilities to initiate in-the-field-surveillance requirements in § 170.556(a) or the randomized surveillance considerations in § 170.556(c).</P>",

      "<P>\n                        In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, we adopted requirements in § 170.556(d)(1) that require an ONC-ACB to notify a developer when it determines that a non-conformity exists and require the developer to submit a proposed CAP for the applicable certification criterion, certification criteria, or certification requirement (80 FR 62758). We propose to revise the corrective action plan and procedures in § 170.556(d)(1) to include the Maintenance of Certification requirements specified in subpart D for which we propose an ONC-ACB would have responsibilities for under § 170.523 (discussed in the section III.D.2.b above). We expect the ONC-ACB to initiate surveillance as necessary to assess whether the developer has met the Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements obligations under subpart D of part 170—for which we propose the ONC-ACB to have oversight responsibilities—in the same manner as it initiates surveillance for other Program requirements. We propose to require that an ONC-ACB notify the developer of health IT, when an ONC-ACB determines, through surveillance under § 170.556 or otherwise, that the health IT developer is out of compliance with the specified Maintenance of Certification requirement and to require the developer submit a proposed CAP for the applicable Maintenance of Certification requirement.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63607\"/>\n                    </P>",

Specifically, we finalized in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)-(vi) six minimum required elements that an ONC-ACB must verify are included in the CAP submitted by the developer of health IT. We now propose to revise § 170.556(d)(3), which requires the ONC-ACB to verify the elements of the CAP, to account for the proposed addition of certain Maintenance of Certification requirements that we propose an ONC-ACB must include in its surveillance activities.</P>",
      "<P>We do not find all existing CAP requirements equally necessary for non-conformities that involve the proposed new responsibilities for ONC-ACBs to initiate corrective procedures for specified subpart D Maintenance of Certification requirements, we also propose to specify different minimum required CAP elements based on the type of non-conformity the plan addresses. We believe that establishing certain minimum expectations and procedures for initiating CAP procedures for specified subpart D Maintenance of Certification requirements would provide ONC-ACBs, as well as health IT developers and users, with greater clarity and predictability regarding this aspect of the Program. Furthermore, ONC-ACBs have unique experience working directly with developers to remedy identified non-conformities to the requirements of certification codified in subparts A, B, C, and E, as well as verifying and confirming a developer has met its obligations with the Maintenance of Certification requirements for real world testing and attestations. This experience translates well to having ONC-ACBs conduct surveillance for certain Maintenance of Certification requirements for which we propose the ONC-ACBs have specific responsibilities. We note that our expectations regarding an ONC-ACBs' surveillance responsibilities specific to the oversight and enforcement requirements of certification would not change with the addition of certain Maintenance of Certification requirements under our revisions and additions proposed in § 170.556(b) reactive surveillance and (d) corrective action plan and procedures.</P>",

In § 170.556(d)(3)(iii), we propose to list the minimum required elements for non-conformities with respect to any Program requirement codified in subpart D of this part for which the ONC-ACBs would have responsibility under § 170.523.

We also propose to shift the currently codified CAP elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv) to § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C), respectively. The proposed revised elements are substantially the same elements currently codified in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)-(vi), and we do not propose revisions to the regulatory text in the newly shifted § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(A). For these elements, we only propose to revise the level of paragraphs.</P>",
      "<P>To account for the proposed shifting of elements and the addition of the Maintenance of Certification to the ONC-ACBs' oversight responsibilities, we propose to revise paragraph (d)(3)(i) to specify that for each identified non-conformity with respect to any Program requirement, the ONC-ACB must verify that the associated CAP includes the following, at a minimum: a description of the identified non-conformities (§ 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A)); the timeframe under which corrective action will be completed (§ 170.556(d)(3)(i)(B)); and, an attestation by the developer that it has completed all elements of the approved CAP (§ 170.556(d)(3)(i)(C)). The proposed required elements would apply to proposed CAPs that aim to remedy identified non-conformities for a certified Health IT Module that does not conform to the applicable requirements of its certification and/or when the health IT developer is out of compliance with Maintenance of Certification requirements specified in subpart D of this part for which the ONC-ACB has specific responsibilities under § 170.523. We propose to require the minimum required elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B), and (C) because we believe that certain elements should serve as the baseline of information for any type of non-conformity the CAP addresses.</P>",
      "<P>We also believe certain minimum required elements should still apply regarding non-conformities with respect to any Program requirement codified in subparts A, B, C, or E of part 170. To account for our restructuring of the current minimum six elements in § 170.556(d)(3), in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii), we propose to shift and revise the other three remaining minimum required elements in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv) as § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C). For a Health IT Module that does not conform to the certification requirements codified in subparts A, B, C, or E of part 170, we propose in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii) that for each CAP submitted by the developer, the ONC-ACB shall verify the CAP includes the required elements specified in proposed § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(A) through (C), in addition to the proposed required elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C). We note that these proposed three minimum required elements are the same three minimum required elements that are codified in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)-(iv), with proposed minor modifications. We propose to distinguish the elements in this way to account for the proposed elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) that we would not require for CAPs pertaining to non-compliance with the certification requirements codified in subparts A, B, C, and E of part 170.</P>",

For clarity, we propose to revise the proposed CAP element identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(B) (currently designated in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)). We clarify that this required element for CAPs does not mean that on-site surveillance at a deployed site is the only means through which an ONC-ACB could identify a technical non-conformity. Thus, we propose in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(B) that the ONC-ACBs may identify a technical non-conformity at any location where surveillance procedures have been conducted resulting in an identified non-conformity, and for all other potentially affected customers and users.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We also propose a minor revision in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(C) (currently codified in § 170.556(d)(3)(iv)) to improve the readability of the required element. We note that in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(C), part of \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63608\"/>\n                        the CAP required element addresses how the developer will ensure that all affected, and potentially affected customers and users are alerted to the identified non-conformities, including a detailed description of how the developer will assess the scope and impact of the problem and identify all potentially affected customers. We clarify our expectation with this requirement is two pronged. Satisfying the element would include (1) how the health IT developer identifies the potentially affected customers and (2) identifying who is the actual affected customer(s) by including a detailed description of how the health IT developer will promptly ensure that all potentially affected customers are notified of the non-conformity and plan for resolution. During the CAP process, an ONC-ACB instructs the developer to submit a proposed CAP, or a revised proposed CAP, to remedy the non-conformity. The ONC-ACB also verifies the attestation by the developer that it has completed all elements of the approved CAP (§ 170.556(d)(3)(i)(C)). We believe requiring developers to identify affected customers during the CAP approval process as part of the element in § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(C) is helpful for several reasons, most notably that it aligns with the requirements in our enforcement mechanisms in § 170.580. It would also be useful information when we need to verify communications with a customer(s), as well as aid with Federal agency coordination by identifying the names and the number of affected customers who participate in other HHS programs. We welcome comment on our expectations and whether we should consider codifying this element as two separate requirements.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Recognizing the diversity of non-conformities, we propose, in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii), different required minimum elements for CAPs submitted for addressing non-compliance with Maintenance of Certification requirements specified in subpart D. We propose to require that an ONC-ACB verify that the proposed minimum required elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B), and (C) are included in a CAP pertaining to Maintenance of Certification requirements. Additionally, to better address the variations in types of non-conformities to Program requirements, we propose in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) to implement specific required elements for each identified non-conformity with respect to any Program requirement codified in subpart D of this part for which the ONC-ACB has responsibilities under § 170.523 of this part (we refer readers to section III.D.2.b for a list of these proposed responsibilities in § 170.523). Thus, for all Maintenance of Certification requirement non-conformities, an ONC-ACB must verify that a CAP includes the proposed elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B), in addition to the three minimum required elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B), and (C).</P>",
      "<P>The proposed required elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) would require ONC-ACBs to confirm how the developer will address and resolve identified non-conformities with Maintenance of Certification requirements for which the ONC-ACBs have responsibilities under proposed § 170.523. We propose to set forth different elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) for CAPs addressing non-conformities with certain Maintenance of Certification requirements because of the administrative nature of these requirements compared to, for example, the certification requirements of subparts A, B, C. The elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) enhance the process for developers to regain compliance with the Maintenance of Certification requirements in several ways. The proposal in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) would require a developer to outline the actions needed to address non-conformities related to Maintenance of Certification requirements, providing clarity in addressing the non-conformity; while the requirement in § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(B) underscores the importance of ensuring comprehensive resolution for all identified non-conformities specific to the Maintenance of Certification requirements. These elements will aid developers in crafting CAPs tailored to the distinct challenges posed by Maintenance of Certification requirements, contributing to a clearer regulatory framework. By specifying actions related to Maintenance of Certification requirements, the elements offer explicit requirements, reduce ambiguity, and align requirements with the regulatory intent of maintaining industry-wide compliance and quality standards. This specificity supports ONC-ACBs' effective oversight, allowing them to assess the adequacy and thoroughness of CAPs and ensuring ongoing compliance with certification requirements.

This flexibility is consistent with prior surveillance requirements, and we would continue to give ONC-ACBs substantial flexibility and discretion to decide how to implement these requirements as part of their overall approach to surveillance (80 FR 16880). Such flexibility is important for minimizing the burden of surveillance on all interested parties, while ensuring that an ONC-ACB can approach surveillance in a way that effectively encourages and supports developers' successful correction of non-conformities with Program requirements.

During this surveillance, the ONC-ACB receives information indicating the developer may have failed to submit a real world testing plan that demonstrates compliance to the full scope of the applicable certification criteria and functions requirements, including § 170.315(b). A certified Health IT Module that fails to successfully demonstrate full compliance of certification capabilities is treated as any other observation of a failure to meet specific Program requirements.

      "<P>Because the ONC-ACB has identified a non-conformity pertaining to Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.405(b), the ONC-ACB must verify the CAP includes the proposed required elements identified in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A), (B), (C), and § 170.556(d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B). The CAP outlines a step-by-step approach and timeline for the developer to address the non-conformities. The ONC-ACB would require, under the proposed elements in § 170.556(d)(3), that the CAP address the non-conformity with § 170.315(b) and include the required elements in § 170.556(d)(3)(i)(A) through (C); and § 170.556(d)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) as it pertains to a non-conformity for subparts A, B, C, or E of this part. The ONC-ACB may also require the developer to include elements in the CAP beyond those specified in proposed § 170.556(d) as the minimum required elements, according to the proposed addition of § 170.556(d)(3)(iv).</P>",
      "<P>With the ONC-ACBs guidance, the developer is able to provide an acceptable proposed CAP to the ONC-ACB addressing the two identified non-conformities, who verifies all the required elements to ensure effective resolution of the identified non-conformities and approves them. The CAP provides a roadmap for the developer to rectify real world testing Maintenance of Certification non-conformities, enhance interoperability, optimize decision support features, ensure timely updates, and update documentation and training materials.</P>",
      "<P>The ONC-ACB continues its monitoring of the certified Health IT Module, including implementation of the CAP and progress towards resolution of the non-conformities. Follow-up assessments may be scheduled to confirm sustained compliance, aligning with the ONC-ACB's commitment to continuous improvement in the EHR system's reliability and adherence to certification criteria. The ONC-ACB ensures successful resolution of identified non-conformities and confirms that the Health IT Module now complies with all applicable certification criteria and Maintenance of Certification requirements for real world testing.</P>"

      "<P>\n                        In some circumstances, despite an ONC-ACB's effort to engage and encourage the developer, a developer's non-conformity with Maintenance of Certification or other Program requirements may not be successfully addressed. Under existing regulations, ONC-ACBs shall initiate suspension procedures for a Health IT Module for the following reasons: a developer does not submit a proposed CAP in the \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63610\"/>\n                        allotted time (§ 170.556(d)(5)(i)); a developer does not submit a revised proposed CAP within the allotted time resulting in the ONC-ACB being unable to approve a CAP (§ 170.556(d)(5)(ii)); and, if the developer does not complete the corrective actions specified in the approved CAP (§ 170.556(d)(5)(iii)). We propose to revise § 170.556(d)(5) to require that an ONC-ACB to initiate suspension procedures where a developer fails to propose a CAP, fails to propose an acceptable CAP, or fails to successfully complete an approved CAP for identified non-conformities with respect to those Maintenance of Certification requirements for which an ONC-ACB would have PoPC and surveillance responsibilities. This proposal would be a parallel complement to the existing requirement for an ONC-ACB to initiate suspension procedures for analogous failures of corrective action procedures to successfully resolve non-conformities of a Health IT Module to the requirements of its certification.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We note that under current requirements in § 170.556(d)(6), which we do not propose to substantively revise in this proposed rule, if a certified Health IT Module's certification has been suspended, then an ONC-ACB is permitted to initiate certification withdrawal procedures for the Health IT Module (consistent with its accreditation to ISO/IEC 17065 and procedures for withdrawing a certification) when the health IT developer has not completed the actions necessary to reinstate the suspended certification. Therefore, if an ONC-ACB initiates suspension procedures in accordance with proposed § 170.556(d)(5) with respect to an identified non-conformity for a Program requirement codified in subpart D for which the ONC-ACB has responsibilities under § 170.523, it may initiate certification withdrawal procedures in accordance with § 170.556(d)(6).</P>",
      "<P>While the Maintenance of Certification requirements pertain to developer behaviors, we consider the specific Maintenance of Certification requirements that an ONC-ACB would have for PoPC and surveillance responsibilities to be entirely administrative in nature. The ONC-ACBs would not make a determination to suspend or withdraw certification based on developer behavior, such as non-compliance with information blocking requirements as specified in § 170.401. Instead, the ONC-ACB would carry out its obligations specified in § 170.556(d)(5) and (6) in response to a developer's failure to meet the CAP related to administrative and routine activities such as submitting a real world testing plan on time. Furthermore, ONC-ACBs and developers have experience with initiating suspensions and withdrawals for developers who fail to engage in the CAP process pertaining to certification non-conformities, and we anticipate that the ONC-ACBs could transition to applying § 170.556(d)(5) and (6) procedures to the proposed CAP procedures for Maintenance of Certification non-conformities without much additional effort. Developers too are also familiar with the process so we expect engaging in the suspension and withdrawal processes for Maintenance of Certification non-conformities would not place much additional burden on them.</P>",
      "<P>We note that delegating suspensions and withdrawal responsibilities to ONC-ACBs for Maintenance of Certification non-conformities would not mean the National Coordinator does not have authority to review ONC-ACB action(s). As discussed in detail in the section III.D.2.b, we propose to revise the PoPCs to add a requirement in § 170.523(iii)(4) that ONC-ACBs must notify the National Coordinator prior to initiating a suspension or withdrawal as specified in § 170.556 for a non-conformity pertaining to a Maintenance of Certification requirement for which the ONC-ACBs have responsibilities. We also note in § 170.580(a)(3)(ii) that ONC may assert exclusive review of certified health IT as to any matters under review by ONC, and any similar matters under surveillance by an ONC-ACB.</P>",
      "<P>While we believe that ONC-ACBs are well suited to conducting surveillance and coordinating with developers of certified health IT to resolve certain Maintenance of Certification requirement non-conformities, we also acknowledge that there may be instances when a developer fails to timely submit an acceptable proposed CAP or complete an approved CAP, despite an ONC-ACBs efforts to gather and verify this information. In these instances, we believe it is necessary for an ONC-ACB to notify the National Coordinator that a developer failed to submit or complete a CAP addressing these specific Maintenance of Certification non-conformities so that the National Coordinator may review the information and proceed accordingly. Therefore, we propose to add, as paragraph (d)(7) of § 170.556, new requirements for an ONC-ACB to report specific information to ONC when a developer fails to timely submit or complete an approved CAP. This proposal would apply to an identified non-conformity with respect to any Program requirement codified in subpart D for which the ONC-ACB has responsibilities under § 170.523.</P>",
      "<P>Under the proposal in § 170.556(d)(7), we would require an ONC-ACB to notify the National Coordinator when the ONC-ACB's requirement to initiate suspension procedures is triggered by the developer's failure to engage (successfully or failure to engage at all, as applicable) with the CAP process for a non-conformity to a Maintenance of Certification requirement. Specifically, we propose in § 170.556(d)(7)(i) that an ONC-ACB must immediately notify the National Coordinator if one or more of the following occurs: 1) the developer has not submitted a proposed CAP; 2) the ONC-ACB cannot approve a CAP because the developer has not submitted a revised proposed CAP; or 3) the developer has not completed the corrective actions specified by an approved CAP within the time specified therein. We propose this requirement to strengthen transparency within the Program as well as encourage developer compliance with the Program. Additionally, this information would inform the National Coordinator whether the ONC-ACB met its obligations to notify the developer of the surveillance activity, if there was an identified non-conformity, and how to remediate the non-conformity, including guidance on the required elements in the CAP, as well as the developer's response and level of engagement with the CAP process.</P>",
      "<P>To further accomplish our goal of increased transparency and encouraging developer compliance, we propose in § 170.556(d)(7)(ii) that an ONC-ACB must report certain information to ONC when a developer fails to submit a proposed CAP that can be approved, or complete an approved CAP with respect to any Program requirement codified in subpart D for which an ONC-ACB has responsibilities under § 170.523. We propose to add the requirement that an ONC-ACBs shall report the information specified in § 170.523(x) (discussed in section III.D.2.b above) to the National Coordinator pursuant to the requirements specified in § 170.556(d)(7)(i), and we propose to add the requirement in § 170.556(d)(7)(ii)(A) that an ONC-ACBs must notify the developer immediately when an ONC-ACB begins the notification procedures in § 170.556(d)(7)(i).</P>",

      "<P>To date, we have handled the infrequent occurrence of an ONC-ACB withdrawing from the Program by working collaboratively with that departing ONC-ACB and the other remaining ONC-ACBs to enable an orderly transition of certifications administered by the departing ONC-ACBs. However, as the Program has matured and the scope of an ONC-ACB's responsibilities has increased (including proposals in this proposed rule), a requirement for an ONC-ACB to provide notice to the National Coordinator when it intends to withdraw from the Program would further support an orderly transition. Accordingly, we propose in § 170.523(y) a new Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs requiring an ONC-ACB to give the National Coordinator sufficient notice of its intent to withdraw its authorization under the Program. We believe that notice provided 180 days (day is defined in § 170.102 as a calendar day or calendar days) prior to the ONC-ACB's withdraw from the Program would be sufficient time for ONC to work with the ONC-ACB to ensure the ONC-ACB's planned withdrawal does not interrupt Program operations and activities, put its clients at risk of losing their certification(s) under the Program, and/or impact end users' ability to meet their business needs and requirements for participation in other Federal and/or state programs that require the use of certified health IT.</P>",
      "<P>When an ONC-ACB withdraws its authorization from the Program, ONC must work with that ONC-ACB to ensure the ONC-ACB's clients are able to transition to another ONC-ACB and maintain their certified status. For an ONC-ACB to onboard a new client and issue a new certificate based on the evidence supporting a certificate previously issued by another ONC-ACB, it must possess the evidence that supports the prior ONC-ACB's decision. The transition requires the transfer of test records and other documented evidence supporting the certification. Consistent with § 170.523(g)(1), ONC-ACBs are required to retain all records related to the certificates they issue, and per § 170.523(g)(2) make such records available to HHS upon request during the specified retention period. Therefore, to maintain the integrity of the certifications impacted by the ONC-ACB withdrawal, ONC will request records (per § 170.523(g)(2)) from the withdrawing ONC-ACB. These records will provide evidence of conformity with certification requirements to support the remaining ONC-ACBs that take on the withdrawing ONC-ACB's clients. These steps are important because, once an ONC-ACB withdraws from the Program, ONC no longer has authority over the actions of that organization. Furthermore, the influx of incoming business for the ONC-ACBs accepting requests from the withdrawing ONC-ACB's clients must be managed along with their existing workload.</P>",

In § 170.523(y)(2), we propose to require the withdrawing ONC-ACB to submit all of its certification records to ONC pursuant to the retention requirements it followed in § 170.523(g).

The EOA Final Rule established bases on which ONC would initiate direct review, and procedures for ONC to follow in the event ONC's direct review of certified health IT substantiated a non-conformity. Under the framework established in the EOA Final Rule, inquiry into certified health IT's conformance with Program requirements may be conducted by ONC or a third party on ONC's behalf, and the term “direct review” is used to distinguish inquiries and enforcement actions taken under the 45 CFR 170.580 framework from ONC-ACBs' assessments and reviews as part of the ONC-ACB's surveillance and other responsibilities under the Program (85 FR 25738).</P>",

First, these processes were designed to address non-conformities with Program requirements. Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements have been adopted as Program requirements and, as such, any noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements constitutes a Program non-conformity. Second, health IT developers were already familiar with the ONC direct review framework that had been put in place by the EOA Final Rule. Third, 45 CFR 170.580 provides thorough and transparent processes for identifying, notifying, and addressing non-conformities in the Program through coordination with health IT developers to craft a CAP that will remedy Program non-conformities. Fourth, the updated direct review framework provides equitable opportunities for health IT developers to respond to ONC actions and appeal certain ONC determinations. We confirmed in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that we would continue to use the term “direct review” to describe activities of ONC (or a third party on ONC's behalf) under the 45 CFR 170.580 framework and to differentiate them from ONC-ACBs' reviews of certified health IT under their surveillance responsibilities outlined in 45 CFR 170.556 (85 FR 25783).\n                    </P>",

      "<P>\n                        As discussed in section III.D.2.c above, we now have some experience evaluating non-conformities associated with developers failing to comply with administrative Maintenance of Certification requirements in 45 CFR 170 subpart D. We have learned from this experience that some of the mandatory minimum elements that § 170.580(c)(2) currently requires for all CAPs are not equally valuable with respect to all non-conformities. For example, an assessment and description of the nature, severity, and extent of the non-conformity (the element specified in § 170.580(c)(2)(i)) would likely be necessary where the ONC-substantiated non-conformity is that a certified Health IT Module is causing or contributing to a serious risk to public health or safety. The § 170.580(c)(2)(i) element would also likely be necessary in cases where a certified Health IT Module is found to be non-conforming by virtue of failing to satisfy the requirements of all 45 CFR 170 subpart C certification criteria to which it is certified. By contrast, the § 170.580(c)(2)(i) element is not likely to be necessary in many instances where the non-conformity is a failure to meet an administrative requirement under subpart D, such as to timely submit real world testing documentation pursuant to § 170.405(b), or to submit required attestations pursuant to § 170.406. Timely submission of attestations is a pass/fail, readily observed non-conformity for which inclusion of the § 170.580(c)(2)(i) element would not provide helpful or additional information. Similarly, where the resolution of the non-conformity amounts to submitting the overdue attestations or real world testing documentation, the successful resolution is self-documenting, so a detailed description of supporting documentation a developer would provide \n                        <E T=\"03\">to demonstrate</E>\n                         the identified non-conformity is resolved (as specified in § 170.580(c)(2)(vi), emphasis added) generally would not be necessary or add value to the direct review process.\n                    </P>",

Applicable cases would be those where the information and documentation provided in the ONC-ACB's § 170.523(x) report is, in the National Coordinator's view, sufficient to substantiate that a developer has failed to resolve a Program non-conformity related to a Maintenance of Certification requirement within the required timeframe of the CAP verified and approved by the ONC-ACB. The National Coordinator's consideration of the record submitted by the ONC-ACB pursuant to § 170.523(x) would include assessing whether the ONC-ACB had met its obligations to notify the developer of the non-conformity and initiate corrective action procedures under §§ 170.523 and 170.556.</P>",

We also propose revisions to § 170.580(b)(2)(ii)(B) and § 170.580(b)(2)(iii) clarifying that the National Coordinator may adjust the 30-day timeline under § 170.580(b)(2)(ii)(A)(\n                        <E T=\"03\">3</E>\n                        ) and that the National Coordinator makes a determination under § 170.580(b)(2)(iii) after receiving the health IT developer's written explanation and supporting documentation.

In § 170.580(c)(2), we propose that the CAP shall include such required elements that the National Coordinator determines necessary. The CAP shall include, for each specific non-conformity, all the elements in § 170.580(c)(2) except when the elements are explicitly waived by the National Coordinator. We also propose to update § 170.580(c)(7) to provide that a CAP may be reinstituted by ONC if the National Coordinator later determines that a health IT developer has not yet fulfilled all its obligations under the CAP.\n                    </P>",

More specifically, we propose that: (1) excluding situations of noncompliance with a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement under subpart D of this part, the National Coordinator may propose to terminate a certification issued to a Health IT Module when a health IT developer fails to respond timely to a communication from ONC, fails to provide sufficient access or information to ONC, or the National Coordinator concludes that a certified health IT's non-conformity(ies) cannot be cured (§ 170.580(e)(1) and (e)(1)(vii)); (2) ONC will notify the health IT developer of the proposed termination through a notice of proposed termination when the National Coordinator decides to propose to terminate a certification (§ 170.580(e)(2)); and, (3) upon receipt of the health IT 'developer's written response to a notice of proposed termination, the National Coordinator has up to 30 days to make a determination based on ONC's review of the information submitted by the health IT developer and the National Coordinator may extend this timeframe if the complexity of the case requires additional time for ONC review (§ 170.580(4)).</P>"

These “apps” are able to communicate with other health information technology through an API (such as a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(g)(10)) that permits EHI to be accessed and exchanged at the patient's direction.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In the proposed § 171.104(a)(6), we note that certain non-compete clauses can implicate the information blocking definition. In the ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule, we stated that one means by which actors may restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI is through formal, contractual restrictions (84 FR 7518). We provided several examples of restrictive contractual clauses in that proposed rule (84 FR 7518). In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we acknowledged that many \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63619\"/>\n                        commenters stated that EHR developers place onerous contract terms on developers of applications that enable patient access to EHI through APIs (88 FR 25811). Regulated entities, software developers, and patient advocates have continued to express concerns to ONC about restrictive contractual clauses.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Actors are placing conditions on access to EHI in the actor's health IT that are unrelated to security or privacy laws, and function as anti-competitive clauses that effectively prevent certain employees or contractors from accessing, exchanging, or using EHI in other health IT. Therefore, we propose to identify a particular type of contractual clause as an interference: negotiating or enforcing a clause in any agreement that prevents or restricts an employee (other than the actor's employees), contractor, or contractor's employee who accesses, exchanges, or uses the EHI in the actor's health IT from accessing, exchanging, or using EHI in other health IT in order to participate in the design, development, or upgrade of such other health IT. This proposal is intended specifically to make clear that it is an interference to prevent employees of an individual or entity (other than the actor's employees) from working on software development and design for both Company A (actor's company) and Company B, even if the companies are competitors or potential competitors, and even if the work is being conducted simultaneously. We note that this interference could be found in “any agreement,” even an agreement to which the actor is not a party, provided that the actor requires another party to include such a clause in that party's contracts with its employees or contractors. In addition, it is an interference for the actor to negotiate or enforce such a clause—again, in any agreement.</P>",
      "<P>Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finalized a nationwide ban on most non-compete clauses in any employment contract (89 FR 38342). The FTC noted that non-compete clauses have many deleterious effects, including on earnings, job creation, innovation, consumer prices, and new business formation (80 FR 38343). Although the FTC's rule would not cover the types of restrictions that are covered by our proposal, we believe such clauses have the same effects on health information technology by restricting the ability of developers to work on different software and to enter into new contracts at the same time that they are contracted to work with an actor's software. Although the contractual language at issue may occasionally be couched in language claiming to protect intellectual property, the clauses function as anti-competitive clauses and not as clauses protecting intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation. We note that in some cases, there are applicable laws that prevent employees and contractors from misusing intellectual property. Our proposal would not impact legally permissible intellectual property protections. In addition, we note that the Licensing Exception in § 171.303 acknowledges intellectual property rights, including the administration of a reasonable non-disclosure agreement that is no broader than necessary to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the actor's trade secrets.</P>",
      "<P>We solicit comment on all aspects of our proposed description of the interference in § 171.104(a)(6). We specifically ask if we should add “including health IT for a competitor or potential competitor” at the end of the paragraph. We solicit comment on whether it is necessary to say “access, exchange, or use” or if “access or use” of EHI is sufficient. We specifically used the term “agreement” instead of “contract” because we recognize that such clauses can also be found in licensing agreements and other agreements that are not typically referred to as a contract. We also ask, more broadly, whether there are other types of agreements that should specifically be identified in the text of § 171.104(a)(6), such as those specified in the Cures Act rulemaking (84 FR 7518 and 88 FR 25811). Because we recognize that sometimes the actor induces a contractor to include the language in the agreement the contractor has with its employees, we use the phrase “negotiating or enforcing” to ensure that an actor inducing or forcing a customer, business associate, or any other entity to include such restrictions would also be considered an interference. We ask commenters to opine on whether “negotiating or enforcing” is broad enough to cover the situations intended to be covered by the description in § 171.104(a)(6), and whether any terms should be added to the definitions section of the regulation as a result of this or other descriptions of interferences in § 171.104.</P>",
      "<P>We also solicit comments on the rest of the descriptions of interferences in the proposed § 171.104. Are the descriptions clear enough for regulated entities and those whose access, exchange, or use of EHI that might be adversely affected by the conduct to understand the intended policy? Are there other practices that interested parties believe should be explicitly identified in regulatory text as constituting interference? Would codification of more or fewer interferences be more helpful? In considering these questions, we remind readers that “interference” or “interfere with” includes practices that prevent, materially discourage, or otherwise inhibit the access, exchange, and use of EHI.</P>",
      "<P>Finally, we reiterate and emphasize that the descriptions in the proposed § 171.104 are of conduct constituting “interference.” The facts and circumstances of an actor's engaging in any of these practices, or any other practice likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI, would determine whether the practice constitutes “information blocking.” OIG has the statutory authority to investigate allegations of information blocking and to determine whether information blocking has occurred.</P>"

Specifically, it would be unlikely to be an interference for Qualified Health Information Networks\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                         (QHINs), Participants, or Subparticipants to comply with required provisions of the Common Agreement and the incorporated terms of participation and standard operating procedures, respectively. In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we took a similar approach and identified certain practices that we believed would be unlikely to interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI. Specifically, we explained that an actor's practice that focused on educating individuals about the privacy and security risks posed by certain applications would be unlikely to rise to the level of an interference when certain conditions were met, and therefore would be unlikely to meet the definition of information blocking (85 FR 25815).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        Many interested parties, directly and through responses to proposed rules and requests for information, have inquired about the implications of following requirements of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                         (TEFCA\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                        ), including the related terms of participation and standard operating procedures, with respect to the information blocking definition.

We believe providing such guidance with respect to TEFCA requirements is important because when actors choose to access, exchange, and use EHI through TEFCA, their compliance with TEFCA requirements supports the policy goals of the Cures Act and information blocking regulations more broadly, such as to promote confidence in health IT infrastructure and interoperability (see 85 FR 25649, 25794, 25804, 25805, and 25806) by advancing interoperability and expanding secure access, exchange, and use of EHI. We also believe that because the proposed § 171.104 does not describe the full universe of practices that could constitute an interference, it is important to clarify that compliance with TEFCA requirements, in the context of TEFCA participation by a QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant, is unlikely to constitute an interference under the information blocking definition.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Actors who are QHINs, Participants, or Subparticipants have documents relevant to their participation in TEFCA, including documents such as the Common Agreement, terms of participation, and standard operating procedures.

Our guidance does not extend to such permissible or optional practices. To this point, not complying with a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI via the standards adopted in 45 CFR 170.215, including version(s) of those standards approved pursuant to 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8), \n                        <E T=\"03\">could</E>\n                         be an interference, \n                        <E T=\"03\">could</E>\n                         implicate the information blocking definition, and would not be covered by the TEFCA Manner Exception (§ 171.403).

This is because 45 CFR 164.502(g) pertains personal representatives of individuals as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 (persons who are the subject of PHI) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A person described in (a)(2)(i) is an individual as defined in 45 CFR 170.103 for purposes of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, (a)(2)(ii) describes “any \n                        <E T=\"03\">other</E>\n                         natural person who is the subject of the EHI being accessed, exchanged, or used” (emphasis added) rather than an “individual” who is the subject of PHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

By striking an unnecessary cross-reference, this proposal would simplify the regulatory text without changing what the § 171.202(a)(2) definition of “individual” means or how it applies in practice.\n                    </P>"

As we explained in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, these “unreviewable grounds” are related to specific privacy risks or interests and have been established for important public policy purposes, such as when a health care provider is providing treatment in the course of medical research or when a health care provider is acting under the direction of a correctional institution (85 FR 25856).

The current text of § 171.202(d) states that the actor's practice “must be consistent with 45 CFR 164.524(a)(2).” The preamble discussion of this sub-exception explains that an actor who chooses to deny the request must, to satisfy the § 171.202(d) sub-exception, meet the actor's obligations \n                        <SU>235</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

The HIPAA right of access standard (45 CFR 164.524) applies to PHI that is not ePHI (\n                            <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                             paper records), but § 171.202 would be moot with respect to PHI that is not ePHI and therefore does not meet the EHI definition in § 171.102.\n                        </P>\n                    </FTNT>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose to broaden the applicability of the sub-exception so that it is available to any actor responding to a request for EHI where the circumstances set out in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(2)(i) through (v) apply, and not just for actors who are also HIPAA covered entities or business associates. Allowing the same information blocking sub-exception to cover a practice regardless of whether the actor engaging in the practice is also required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not create a misalignment for actors who \n                        <E T=\"03\">are</E>\n                         subject to both the information blocking regulations and the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Actors who are not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule would need to familiarize themselves with up-to-date 45 CFR 164.524 implementation specifications that would apply to the actor's denial of access to the EHI in question in the circumstances set forth in § 164.524(a)(2) if the actor were a HIPAA covered entity or business associate. This is similar to such actors needing to familiarize themselves with the HIPAA Privacy Rule definitions for “ePHI” and “designated record set” (in §§ 160.103 and 164.501) for purposes of understanding the EHI definition in § 171.102. Actors who are not HIPAA covered entities or business associates and who want to obtain help in learning about denials of individual access in the circumstances specified in § 164.524(a)(2) could find a variety of educational sources to choose from.

      "<P>\n                        To clearly establish coverage of the § 171.202(d) sub-exception for all actors' practices under the same requirements, we propose to change the name of the sub-exception to: “interfering with individual access based on unreviewable grounds.” This proposed change to the header text is intended to express the expansion of the sub-exceptions' availability to all actors. Additionally, the proposed regulatory text would remove the current text's reference applying the sub-exception only to actors required to comply with the HIPAA right of access standards and only where the individual is making a request “under the right of access provision under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1).” Instead, the proposed text would provide that the sub-exception applies where an individual requests their EHI from any actor in circumstances set \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63622\"/>\n                        forth in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(2).

      "<P>\n                        In light of the changing landscape, we are concerned that actors might deny or terminate an individual's requested restrictions on sharing their EHI specifically due to uncertainty about whether the actor is aware of and can account for any and all laws that might override the individual's requested restrictions. An actor who might otherwise be inclined to agree to an individual's request not to share their EHI could be concerned about potential information blocking implications of honoring those individual requests in the face of demands for disclosure that \n                        <E T=\"03\">might</E>\n                         ultimately be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In particular, we are concerned that actors may be unwilling to consider granting individuals' requests for restrictions, or may prematurely terminate some or all requested restrictions, based on uncertainty as to whether information blocking penalties or disincentives might be imposed in addition to costs the actor may incur to confirm whether the actor is, by other authority, compelled to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI despite the individual's wishes. For example, we understand actors are concerned about potentially implicating the information blocking definition by delaying a disclosure of EHI pursuant to a court order that the actor is aware is being contested, so that the actor can wait to see if the order will, in fact, compel the actor to make EHI available for access, exchange, or use contrary to the individual's request for restrictions to which the actor had agreed consistent with § 171.202(e). Accordingly, the removal of “unless otherwise required by law” from § 171.202(e) would be a useful complement to the existing Precondition Not Satisfied sub-exception (§ 171.202(b)) to help address actors' uncertainty about various state laws' applicability as they relate to information blocking. As currently codified, § 171.202(b) sub-exception of the Privacy Exception outlines a framework for actors to follow so that the actors' practices of not fulfilling requests to access, exchange, or use EHI would not constitute information blocking when one or more preconditions has not been satisfied for the access, exchange, or use to be permitted under applicable Federal and State, or Tribal laws.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>To be clear, the proposed revision to § 171.202(e) would not operate to override other law compelling disclosure against the individual's wishes. It would, however, offer actors who elect to honor individual requested restrictions certainty that applying those restrictions will not be considered information blocking so long as the actor's practices in doing so satisfy the requirements of the § 171.202(e) sub-exception. Whether the courts will or should apply any particular Federal, state, or Tribal law to any actor (or enforce orders issued under such laws to any actor in any particular circumstances) is beyond the scope of this proposal. If or where there may be a law that is enforced by a court with jurisdiction over the actor and subject matter and that requires a particular actor to fulfill access, exchange, or use of EHI without the individual's authorization, permission, or consent, the actor might be compelled to comply with that law independent of the information blocking statute and 45 CFR part 171. This would continue to be the case even if we were to finalize the proposed revision to § 171.202(e).</P>",
      "<P>We also remind HIPAA covered entities and business associates that they must comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule and any other applicable Federal laws that limit access, exchange, or use of EHI in particular circumstances. For example, an actor's practice likely to interfere with an individual's access, exchange, or use of EHI (as defined in 45 CFR 171.102) might satisfy an information blocking exception without fully satisfying the actor's separate obligations under 45 CFR 164.524 (HIPAA Privacy Rule's individual right of access). In such cases, an actor that is a HIPAA covered entity or business associate would be subject to penalties for violating the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</P>",

Referencing the entirety of § 171.202 in § 171.204(a)(2)(ii) would, therefore, also extend application of the Infeasibility Exception's \n                        <E T=\"03\">segmentation</E>\n                         condition to situations where a health IT developer of certified health IT that is not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule may withhold EHI they could otherwise lawfully make available based on an organizational privacy policy consistent with the § 171.202(c) sub-exception.

We believe it is possible that some individuals might seek health care or other services from such developers' customers (including health care providers) who are not HIPAA covered entities. In such situations, a State, or Tribal law may operate to provide the individual rights to access their health information that the actor has. (Determining what other laws may operate, or how, in specific circumstances is beyond the scope of this proposed rule.) Although the number of such situations may be relatively small, we do recognize it is possible for some individuals to find themselves in situations where no other law explicitly guarantees them a right to access EHI of which the individual is the subject (or the legal representative of the subject). In such situations, the individual may rely solely on the information blocking statute to ensure actors will not unreasonably and unnecessarily interfere with the individual's EHI access, exchange, or use. We are, therefore, interested in whether commenters may be concerned about potential unintended consequences of extending the (§ 171.204(a)(2)) \n                        <E T=\"03\">segmentation</E>\n                         condition to situations where a health IT developer is not required to comply with HIPAA and cannot segment EHI they have \n                        <E T=\"03\">chosen</E>\n                         to withhold consistent with the actor's own organizational privacy policies from other EHI.

We welcome commenters' thoughts on this question.

We propose to reference § 171.206 in the proposed revised § 171.204(a)(2)(ii) because the proposed § 171.206(a) \n                        <E T=\"03\">threshold</E>\n                         condition's requirements include (among others) a requirement that the actor's practice be no broader than necessary to reduce the risk of potential exposure of any person(s) to legal action that the actor believes could arise from the particular access, exchange, or use of the specific EHI. The actor's lack of technical capability to sequester only the EHI for which relevant conditions of § 171.206 have been satisfied would not render § 171.206 applicable to interference with the lawful access, exchange, or use of other EHI pertaining to the same individual(s). Therefore, the proposed reference to § 171.206 in the proposed revised § 171.204(a)(2)(ii) would accommodate circumstances where an actor lacks the technical capability to unambiguously segment the EHI the actor has chosen to withhold consistent with the Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206, if finalized) from other EHI that they could lawfully make available.

      "<P>\n                        In the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1436) we excluded from applicability of the \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition of the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204(a)(3)) a health care provider's requests for modification use from an actor that is its business associate. In the HTI-1 Final Rule, we noted that, for reasons stated in response to comments suggesting the condition's applicability exclusion may not be broad enough and in consideration of all comments on our discrete proposal, we did not expand the finalized exclusion from applicability of the condition as some commenters had requested (89 FR 1379). We also noted that we may consider amending the \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition in the future if doing so may be appropriate (89 FR 1379).

As we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23866), covered entities and business associates often have a level of trust and contractual protections that reduce certain concerns, such as security and data provenance, that led us to propose the \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition. In addition, as we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule discussion of the limitation of this condition, covered entities and their business associates (as permitted by their business associate agreements) need to access and modify relevant EHI held by other business associates of those covered entities on a regular basis (88 FR 23866). Therefore, we believe the exclusion from applicability of this condition should encompass requests from all covered entities to their business associates.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We also propose to exclude from applicability of the condition requests from any health care provider (as defined in § 171.102), who is not a HIPAA covered entity (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) but who is requesting modification use from an actor whose activities would make the actor a business associate of that same health care provider if that health care provider were a HIPAA covered entity. Even if a health care provider is not a HIPAA covered entity, a health care provider likely has obligations and responsibilities under State law \n                        <SU>240</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         and according to accreditation organizations' requirements \n                        <SU>241</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         and payers' requirements \n                        <SU>242</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         to keep and maintain medical records. Those responsibilities will likely require a health care provider to be able to regularly access and modify EHI held by entities who perform the functions of a business associate (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) and would be considered a business associate of the health care provider if the health care provider were a covered entity. Further, it is our expectation that even if a health care provider is not a HIPAA covered entity and, therefore, does not have a HIPAA business associate agreement with an actor who maintains EHI or health IT system(s) or application(s) for the health care provider, the health care provider likely would have a pre-existing relationship with the actor similar to the relationship that a covered entity health care provider would have with their business associate, in terms of the existing level of trust, responsibilities, and obligations to handle EHI safely and securely. The health care provider who is not a HIPAA covered entity may be asking for modification use of EHI from an actor for the same purpose(s) that a health care provider who is a covered entity would be. We, therefore, propose to revise the \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition by adding subparagraph (ii) of § 171.204(a)(3) that would exclude from applicability of the condition requests from health care providers (as defined in § 171.102) who are not HIPAA covered entities, requesting modification use from actors who would be considered the health care provider's business associate if the health care provider were a covered entity as defined in 45 CFR 160.103.\n                    </P>",

The proposed revision to § 171.204(b) would retain the requirement that actors communicate to requestors “in writing the reason(s) why the request is infeasible” that we finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25958, preamble discussion at 85 FR 25869).

The concern that ten business days may not allow actors sufficient time to engage with requestors and fully evaluate all factors relevant to meeting certain conditions in § 171.204(a) has also been raised by various actors in both written informal correspondence and real-time interactions since the publication of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642). We have also received inquiries from these same actors as to what constitutes a “request” for purposes of the Infeasibility Exception. These inquiries specific to § 171.204(b) have generally centered on how we would \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63626\"/>\n                        determine when the ten-day “clock” for providing a written response begins.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We believe defining in regulation what constitutes a “request” or “actionable request” is unnecessary and could have more undesirable effects than desirable effects. We believe it would be difficult to define a single set of characteristics that every person's communication or conduct would need to satisfy before their communication to an actor, or other interaction with an actor or with health IT maintained or deployed by the actor, indicating the person seeks EHI access, exchange, or use would be considered a “request” for purposes of the information blocking regulations. Such specifications would increase complexity of the regulations and risk increasing rather than decreasing barriers to requestors' obtaining access, exchange, or use of EHI permitted under applicable law and, where applicable, consistent with patients' expressed individual preferences for privacy-protective restrictions beyond those required by law. In light of both experience over the four years since the ONC Cures Act Final Rule was published and the revisions that were finalized to the § 171.204(a) conditions in the HTI-1 Final Rule (89 FR 1436 through 1437, preamble discussion at 89 FR 1373 through 1387), we believe it remains appropriate to include as a condition of the Infeasibility Exception that the actor provide written responses within timeframes specified by the § 171.204(b) \n                        <E T=\"03\">responding to requests</E>\n                         condition. However, we have determined that the optimal timeframes to specify in § 171.204 going forward may vary based on the specific condition in § 171.204(a) that is satisfied.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose to retain, as new subparagraph (1) of § 171.204(b), the current § 171.204(b) requirement for a written response within ten business days of the actor receiving a request where the infeasibility of fulfilling requested access, exchange, or use of EHI satisfies the § 171.204(a)(1) \n                        <E T=\"03\">uncontrollable events</E>\n                         condition, § 171.204(a)(2) \n                        <E T=\"03\">segmentation</E>\n                         condition, or the § 171.204(a)(3) \n                        <E T=\"03\">third party seeking modification use</E>\n                         condition. We believe ten business days should be adequate time for an actor to recognize that a request that the actor has received, and that the actor might otherwise be able to fulfill, is not feasible in specific circumstances where an uncontrollable event has adversely impacted the actor's ability to fulfill the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI. Ten business days should also be sufficient for an actor to recognize that they cannot fulfill a request for EHI access, exchange, or use for reasons consistent with § 171.204(a)(2) \n                        <E T=\"03\">segmentation</E>\n                         condition or where a third party is seeking modification use in circumstances where § 171.204(a)(3) applies. However, we propose to revise the wording of the requirement from “receipt of” to “the actor receiving” to address what we believe some actors may experience as uncertainty regarding when one would start counting the ten business days in circumstances where fulfilling a request is infeasible for reasons consistent with § 171.204(a)(1).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We recognize that there is significant variation in how people make requests and for what purposes, as well as the manners in which they seek to achieve access, exchange, or use of EHI. We also recognize that mechanisms and workflows for receiving and reviewing requests may vary, even within a single actor's operations, based on characteristics of the request. For example, fulfillment of patient requests for EHI access, exchange, or use that can be received and supported automatically via a cloud-based patient portal unaffected by a particular uncontrollable event would continue to be feasible even while the impact of an uncontrollable event on the actor's systems or operational status has rendered the actor unable to receive other requests from, for example, payers or health care providers.</P>",
      "<P>An uncontrollable event's impact on a particular actor's systems or operational status may render it infeasible for the actor to receive some requests until a time when restoration or recovery efforts have progressed far enough that the actor's staff are able to access and use the actor's systems. For example, for some types of request and actor workflows, it may be necessary that: (1) application(s) involved in receiving and responding to requests for EHI access, exchange, and use are operational; and (2) appropriate staff are able to safely and securely log into and use the application(s). Once those two things are true again following an uncontrollable event, we would expect the actor's staff to resume receiving and appropriately dispositioning requests. By revising the wording to focus explicitly on the actor receiving the request, we hope the proposed revised wording will make it easier for actors to consider the distinction between requests that can be received and processed using only automated means and requests that require a human to do something—such as log into a system or obtain and open a piece of paper mail—in order for the actor to, in fact, receive the request.</P>",
      "<P>Similarly, we believe revising the wording to focus on the actor receiving the request clarifies when the ten-day clock starts in scenarios where third parties seek modification use. From the point the actor receives the request, we believe ten business days is sufficient time for an actor to both determine and respond in writing to the requestor that the request is infeasible consistent with § 171.204(a)(3).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In this proposed rule, we propose to define “business day” or “business days” in § 170.102 for purposes of the ONC Health IT Certification Program. For preamble discussion of this proposed definition of “business day” or “business days,” please see section III.D.1 of this proposed rule. We propose to adopt this same definition in § 171.102 for purposes of 45 CFR part 171. This proposal that is specific to the definition of “business day” or “business days” for purposes of 45 CFR part 171 is aligned with but is independent of the proposal to adopt the proposed definition of “business day” or “business days” discussed in section III.D.1 of this proposed rule for purposes of 45 CFR part 170. Therefore, commenters should be aware that we could choose to adopt the full proposed definition in § 171.102, instead of a cross-reference to § 170.102, for purposes of 45 CFR part 171 if we do not also adopt the definition for purposes of 45 CFR part 170. We welcome comment on this proposal specific to adoption of the definition (discussed in section III.D.1 and shown in the proposed revisions to § 170.102 in this proposed rule) for purposes of 45 CFR part 171 in general and as it would apply to the \n                        <E T=\"03\">responding to requests</E>\n                         condition of the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204(b)).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        A proposed new subparagraph (2) in the proposed revised § 171.204(b) would apply where fulfilling a request is infeasible under the \n                        <E T=\"03\">manner exception exhausted</E>\n                         condition (§ 171.204(a)(4)) or the \n                        <E T=\"03\">infeasible under the circumstances</E>\n                         condition (§ 171.204(a)(5)). Under this proposal, the ten-day clock would start after the actor determines, without unnecessary delay and based on a reasonable assessment of the facts, that the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI cannot be provided consistent with § 171.301 or that fulfilling the request is infeasible under the circumstances. We expect that any actors who find themselves attempting to fulfill a request consistent with § 171.301 will be aware that the attempt to fulfill the request could instead result in infeasibility consistent with the § 171.204(a)(4) \n                        <E T=\"03\">manner exception exhausted</E>\n                         condition.

Similarly, we expect that any actor who embarks on the consideration of factors in paragraph (i) of the \n                        <E T=\"03\">infeasible under the circumstances</E>\n                         condition (§ 171.204(a)(5)) will be aware that their consideration of these factors could lead to either a successful fulfilment of requested access, exchange, or use of EHI or a determination that complying with the request would be infeasible under the circumstances. Therefore, we expect the actor would, in good faith and without unnecessary delay, interact with the requestor to ascertain the scope and requested manner of EHI access, exchange, or use and obtain any additional information needed to support the actor's prompt consideration of the § 171.204(a)(5) factors.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>• We propose an additional requirement for a specific maximum timeframe for the § 171.204(b)(2)(i) determination of infeasibility related to § 171.301. Under this additional requirement, the maximum timeframe would be one of the following: three, five, ten, twenty, or thirty business days.</P>",
      "<P>• We propose an additional requirement that for § 171.204(b)(2) to be met, the determination and communication of infeasibility (for reasons consistent with § 171.204(a)(4) or (5)) would have to be made within the timeframe permitted under 45 CFR 164.524 for providing access to PHI where a request for EHI access, exchange, or use is one that implicates the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions for individual access to PHI (45 CFR 164.524) in addition to implicating the information blocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171.</P>",
      "<P>We welcome comments on the possible additional requirements proposed above.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Please note, if ONC adopts the alternative proposal above that specifically references 45 CFR 164.524 for purposes of § 171.204(b)(2), we intend to apply the timeframes required under that section when a request for individual EHI access, exchange, or use is received by the actor. Thus, under the alternative proposal's requirements that would limit maximum available response time under the \n                        <E T=\"03\">responding to requests</E>\n                         condition where the request for EHI implicates 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) the timeframe would be limited to the timeframe required under 45 CFR 164.524. We also highlight for readers' awareness that HHS has proposed to revise 45 CFR 164.524(b)(2) to shorten the timeframes allowed to respond to individual requests for access to PHI (see 86 FR 6459 through 6460 and 86 FR 6535). In the event that changes to the 45 CFR 164.524 timeframes were to be finalized in a future HIPAA rule, the shorter timeframes would (upon becoming effective) apply to the alternative proposed additional requirement for responding to requestors where paragraph (b)(2) of the Infeasibility Exception would apply.\n                    </P>"

      "<P>As we explained in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, the information blocking provision in PHSA section 3022 was enacted in response to concerns about practices that “unreasonably limit the availability and use of electronic health information (EHI) for authorized and permitted purposes” because such practices “undermine public and private sector investments in the nation's health IT infrastructure, and frustrate efforts to use modern technologies to improve healthcare quality and efficiency, accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice to healthcare consumers” (85 FR 25790). We also noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that research suggests that information blocking practices “weaken competition among health care providers by limiting patient mobility” and “unnecessarily impede the flow of EHI or its use to improve health and the delivery of care” (85 FR 25791). As required by section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA, we recognized that certain reasonable and necessary activities that could otherwise meet the definition of information blocking should not be considered information blocking, and therefore, established the initial eight “exceptions” to the definition of information blocking (see 45 CFR 171 Subpart B and C; a ninth exception was established by the HTI-1 Final Rule in Subpart D). Each reasonable and necessary activity identified as an exception to the information blocking definition does not constitute information blocking for purposes of section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA if the conditions of the exception are met (85 FR 25649).</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Since the first eight regulatory exceptions to the information blocking definition were finalized in 2020 (see ONC Cures Act Final Rule, 85 FR 25642), the legal landscape has changed significantly for many patients seeking, and for health care providers providing, reproductive health care. In the wake of the decision in \n                        <E T=\"03\">Dobbs</E>\n                         v. \n                        <E T=\"03\">Jackson Women's Health Organization,</E>\n                         597 U.S. 215 (2022) decision, some States have newly enacted or are newly enforcing restrictions on access to reproductive health care. Uncertainties and other concerns that people who seek reproductive health care and people who provide or facilitate that care have about the legal landscape in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling—and subsequent State restrictions on reproductive health care—have had far-reaching implications for health care beyond access to abortion. This changing legal landscape increases the likelihood that a patient's EHI may be disclosed in ways that erode trust in health care providers and the health care system, ultimately chilling an individual's willingness to seek, or other persons' willingness to provide or facilitate, lawful health care as well as individuals' willingness to provide full information to their health care providers.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>As a practical matter, a person's ability to access care of any kind depends on a variety of factors including whether the care is available. For health care to be available, licensed health care professionals and health care facilities must be willing to provide it—and people other than the licensed health care professionals must be willing to take on various roles essential to delivering care in this modern, technology-enabled environment. Also, patients' access to care may rely in some part on services or supports from other persons, such as a spouse or partner.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In the current environment, various jurisdictions might enact legislation or attempt to enforce law that purports to authorize administrative, civil, or criminal legal action against persons who engage in reproductive health care that is required or authorized by Federal law or that is permitted by the law of the jurisdiction where the care is provided. Fear of being investigated or of having to defend themselves against potential legal liability under such laws, even where the health care provider or other person has reasonable confidence the defense will be successful, may impact people's willingness to provide or assist in reproductive health care that is lawful under the circumstances in which such health care is provided.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63628\"/>\n                    </P>",
      "<P>On April 26, 2024, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued the “HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy” final rule (89 FR 32976) (2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule) to adopt a prohibition on the use or disclosure of PHI by an entity regulated under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, in certain circumstances, for the following purposes:</P>",
      "<P>• To conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating lawful reproductive health care.</P>",
      "<P>• To impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care.</P>",
      "<P>• To identify any person for any purpose described above.</P>",
      "<P>As noted in the National Coordinator's ONC Health IT blog post titled “Supporting Information Privacy for Patients, Now and Always: Four Reminders of How HHS Information Blocking Regulations Recognize Privacy Rules,” on and after the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule's effective date, a HIPAA covered entity's or business associate's practice of refusing to make a use or disclosure of PHI that is prohibited under that rule is excluded from the information blocking definition (45 CFR 171.103) because that refusal is required by law. Therefore, the practice does not need to be covered by any information blocking exception because it is not considered information blocking to begin with.</P>",
      "<P>The 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule also establishes a requirement for HIPAA covered entities and business associates to obtain attestations prior to using or disclosing PHI potentially related to reproductive health care for certain purposes (see 45 CFR 164.509 at 89 FR 33063). The Precondition Not Satisfied (45 CFR 171.202(b)) sub-exception of the information blocking Privacy Exception outlines a framework actors can follow so that the actors' practices of not fulfilling requests to access, exchange, or use EHI would not be considered information blocking when a precondition of applicable law has not been satisfied. By meeting the Precondition Not Satisfied sub-exception's requirements, the actor can have confidence that their practices of not sharing EHI because they have not obtained the required attestation will not be considered information blocking.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule's new protections do not prohibit use or disclosure of PHI for various purposes other than those specified in 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii), though the protections include additional preconditions or limitations on disclosures for certain purposes (for more information, please see the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule (89 FR 32976) and consider visiting the HHS.gov Health Information Privacy section's HIPAA and Reproductive Health page: \n                        <E T=\"03\">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/reproductive-health/index.html</E>\n                        ). The 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule does not require a HIPAA covered entity or business associate to obtain the attestations specified in 45 CFR 164.509 before disclosing PHI (including PHI potentially related to reproductive health care) for permissible purposes other than those specified in 45 CFR 164.512(d), (e), (f), or (g)(1). For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule continues to provide for uses and disclosures of PHI for treatment, payment or health care operations purposes (see 45 CFR 164.506) that do not meet any of the prohibitions set out in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(5)(iii). Thus, an actor choosing to deny requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI for a purpose permitted under HIPAA is not making a denial that is “required by law” specifically under HIPAA. As a result, the information blocking definition could be implicated unless another applicable law requires the denial or a regulatory exception applies. Similarly, an actor conditioning fulfilment of such requests on preconditions that an actor chooses to set (such as that the requestor provides an attestation that is not required by any privacy law that applies in the circumstances) could implicate the information blocking definition unless an exception applies to that practice.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>It may be helpful to pause here for a brief review of how the information blocking regulations, which are based on statutory authority separate from HIPAA, operate (independently of regulations promulgated under HIPAA). This background information may help readers understand how and why an actor may be concerned about potentially implicating the information blocking definition (and penalties or disincentives for information blocking authorized by the information blocking statute) if the actor engages in practices that the HIPAA Privacy Rule would require of a HIPAA covered entity or business associate when the actor is not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        First, information blocking regulations apply to health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, and health information networks (HIN) and health information exchanges (HIE), as each is defined in 45 CFR 171.102. Any individual or entity that meets one of these definitions is an “actor” and subject to the information blocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171, regardless of whether they are also a HIPAA covered entity (CE) or business associate (BA) as those terms are defined in 45 CFR 160.103. Second, for purposes of the information blocking regulations, the definition of “EHI” applies to information “\n                        <E T=\"03\">regardless</E>\n                         of whether the group of records are used or maintained by or for a covered entity as defined in 45 CFR 160.103” (§ 171.102, emphasis added). Therefore, it is possible for an information blocking actor that is not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule to have EHI that is not also PHI. It is also possible for an actor (such as a HIN/HIE) to not be a HIPAA covered entity itself and to exchange, maintain, or otherwise handle EHI on behalf of network participants that are not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Where an actor that is not a HIPAA covered entity has EHI that is not maintained on behalf of a HIPAA covered entity, the actor may be concerned about potential information blocking consequences if the actor were to engage in a practice such as denying requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI that indicates or potentially relates to reproductive health care for purposes for which the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule would prohibit use or disclosure of PHI or would require an attestation as a precondition for permitting disclosure of PHI.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        There is a sub-exception within the Privacy Exception currently codified in § 171.202(c) that is available to a health IT developer of certified health IT “not covered by HIPAA.” The sub-exception is available “if the actor is a health IT developer of certified health IT that is not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, when engaging in a practice that promotes the privacy interests of an individual” (§ 171.202(c), please see § 171.202(c) for the requirements to meet the exception.) However, this exception represents a departure from our general approach of designing each information blocking exception to be available to all actors (regardless of whether they must comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule). The § 171.202(c) sub-exception is also not available to actors who meet the § 171.102 definition of “health care provider” or “HIN/HIE” even if they are not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. (We refer actors and other persons interested in learning more about how the information blocking regulations, and particularly the \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63629\"/>\n                        exceptions, work in concert with the HIPAA Rules and other privacy laws to support health information privacy, to the discussion of this topic in the HTI-1 Final Rule at 89 FR 1351 through 1354.)\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We have come to understand that some health care providers and other actors may have concerns about the risk of potential exposure to legal action flowing from the uses and disclosures of EHI indicating or (in the case of patient health concern(s) or history) potentially relating to reproductive health care that remains permissible under applicable law. For example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits a HIPAA covered entity to disclose an individual's PHI to a health care provider who is not a HIPAA covered entity for treatment activities. Once PHI is in the possession, custody, or control of an entity that is not regulated under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the information is no longer protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</P>",
      "<P>Thus, the HIPAA Privacy Rule's strengthened protections for PHI would not preclude a health care provider (or other recipient of PHI for other permissible purposes) who is not a HIPAA covered entity or business associate from further disclosing individually identifiable health information to someone who might then use the information to potentially impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care (or any other care) that was lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided.</P>",
      "<P>We reiterate that the information blocking statute is separate from the HIPAA statute and that the information blocking regulations operate both separately and differently from the HIPAA regulations. One point of such difference that is key to understanding why we propose a new “Protecting Care Access Exception” (§ 171.206) is that a HIPAA covered entity or business associate is not required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule to make a use or disclosure that the rule merely permits. (The HIPAA Privacy Rule does require certain uses and disclosures of PHI but merely permit various other uses and disclosures.) Persons subject to the information blocking regulations, however, could implicate the information blocking definition if they “interfere with” any access, exchange, or use of EHI except as required by law or covered by an exception. It is the implication of the “information blocking” definition (and the potential to incur penalties or disincentives for engaging in information blocking) that would cause an actor to be concerned about, for instance, refusing to disclose EHI indicating reproductive health care for permissible purposes to an entity not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule and whom the actor has reason to believe does not safeguard the privacy or security of individuals' health information in compliance with the same standards as would be required of a HIPAA covered entity or business associate.</P>",

      "<P>A patient's ability to access care can be adversely affected when a provider believes they could be exposed to legal action based on the mere fact that care is provided. Given the demonstrated chilling effect of some States' laws on the availability of medically appropriate care, it is reasonable and necessary for actors to mitigate risks of potential exposure of health care professionals and other persons who provide or facilitate, as well as those who seek or obtain, reproductive health care that is lawful under the circumstances in which the care is provided to legal action based on the mere fact that such care was sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated. Thus, a new exception is needed to address actors' concerns about potentially implicating the information blocking definition (§ 171.103) if they choose not to share applicable EHI in the circumstances where the Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) would apply. This new proposed exception (§ 171.206) is important in order to ensure health care providers do not feel the need to adopt paper or hybrid recordkeeping methods in place of fully electronic, interoperable formats. Thus, we believe it is reasonable and necessary for an actor to restrict access, exchange, or use of specific EHI that indicates or (under § 171.206(b)) is potentially related to reproductive health care so that health care providers continue to use modern, interoperable health IT that better promotes patient safety than would paper or hybrid recordkeeping methods. Restricting EHI sharing under the conditions of the proposed new Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) is also necessary to preserve and promote public trust in health care professionals, health care, and the health information infrastructure.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose the Protecting Care Access Exception to address actors' concerns about potentially implicating the information blocking definition if they choose not to share EHI in an EHI sharing scenario that an actor believes in good faith could risk exposing a patient, provider, or facilitator of lawful reproductive health care to potential legal action based on what care was sought, obtained, provided, facilitated, or (specific to the \n                        <E T=\"03\">patient protection</E>\n                         condition) is often sought, obtained, or medically indicated for the patient's health condition(s) or history.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not prohibit the use or disclosure of PHI that indicates or is potentially related to “reproductive health care” as it is now defined in 45 CFR 160.103 (see 89 FR 32976 for definition effective June 25, 2024; see also 89 FR 33005 through 33007 for the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule's preamble discussion of that definition) where the use or disclosure is not for a purpose described at 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii) and where the use or disclosure is otherwise required or permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, within the information blocking regulations, the proposed new Protecting Care Access Exception is needed where an information blocking actor (whether or not that actor is required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule) is concerned about the risk of potential exposure to legal action (as we propose in § 171.206(e) to define “legal action”) flowing from an access, exchange, or use of such EHI for a permissible purpose.</P>",
      "<P>We recognize that no information blocking exception can address all of the concerns a person may have about potential legal action for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. However, to the extent such concerns may be mitigated by actors' withholding relevant EHI from access, exchange, or use that all other applicable law would permit and where no other existing information blocking exception applies, we believe such withholding of EHI is reasonable and necessary. We are concerned that actors' uncertainty about whether such withholding of EHI could implicate the information blocking definition could prevent actors from withholding EHI unless an exception applies. Thus, we believe the Protecting Care Access Exception is needed to address actors' concerns specific to information blocking related to the risk of providers changing or limiting what care they are willing to offer (such as when a professional changes practice specialty or a hospital closes a service or department).</P>",
      "<P>When providers limit what care they are willing to offer or what new patients they are willing to accept, it may be more difficult for those who seek care to get access to care they need. When patients' needs are not being met, they lose trust in the health care system and in their physicians. Trust in one's own physician, in general, correlates with better care satisfaction and outcomes. This could also be true of other types of health care providers. Thus, we believe that addressing actors' uncertainty specific to information blocking with the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception would promote better patient satisfaction and health outcomes as well as continued development, public trust in, and effective nationwide use of health information technology infrastructure to improve health and care.</P>",
      "<P>Moreover, actors' uncertainty about the potential information blocking implications of not sharing all of the EHI that applicable laws would permit them to share could undermine health care professionals' (and other health care providers') confidence in their ability to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their patients' EHI. Such a lack of confidence on the part of health care providers can in turn erode a patient's trust.</P>",
      "<P>Patient trust in physician confidentiality and competence is associated with patients being less likely to withhold information from doctors and more likely to agree it is important for health care providers to share information with each other. Thus, actors' narrowly tailored restrictions on (otherwise lawful) sharing of specific EHI in the circumstances addressed by the proposed exception in § 171.206 would be reasonable and necessary to preserve patient trust in the health IT infrastructure and information sharing, not just to protect the availability and safety of care and to promote better care outcomes.</P>",
      "<P>One of the goals of the information blocking exceptions is “to accommodate practices that, while they may inhibit access, exchange, or use of EHI, are reasonable and necessary to advance other compelling policy interests . . .” including “[p]romoting public confidence in the health IT infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI and protecting patient safety,” as we explained in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25791). In the absence of an information blocking exception applicable to risks of legal actions that actors believe could arise from the sharing EHI for permissible purposes (for instance, with entities not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule), we are concerned actors may be unwilling to engage in these practices that—for example—advance public confidence in health IT infrastructure and protect patient safety.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        If actors are unwilling to engage in such practices, health care providers may convey to patients an inability to withhold EHI even when they believe withholding the EHI could mitigate the potential risks cognizable under the \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63631\"/>\n                        Protecting Care Access Exception. If patients are aware that health care providers believe that they are unable to avoid sharing EHI to mitigate risks of potentially exposing care providers, recipients, or facilitators to legal action then patients may be less willing to be candid with their providers about their health history, conditions, or other information relevant to the patient's care. Without that candor, health care providers may be unable to provide care that will best meet the patient's needs.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In addition, a care provider's lack of confidence or competence in their ability to adequately safeguard the privacy of information that care recipients share with them could erode the mutual trust that contributes to better care outcomes by promoting more effective relationships between care providers (including clinicians) and the individuals receiving care.</P>",
      "<P>In the absence of an exception applicable to practices that the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception would cover, we are concerned that health IT developers of certified health IT and HINs/HIEs may be unwilling to take the actions necessary to address their own, or their customer health care provider's, good faith belief that particular sharing of specific EHI could create the risk of potential exposure of a health care provider (or persons seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating care) to legal action regarding health care items and services that are lawful under the circumstances in which such health care is provided. Thus, health care providers in these situations may believe they are faced with a choice between changing what care they offer (such as when a hospital closes a department) or switching at least some portions of their clinical records from electronic to paper formats specifically to avoid concerns that they may be engaged in information blocking.</P>",
      "<P>For health care professionals in reproductive health care specialties or whose practice necessarily includes patients who need reproductive health care, a partial or complete switch to paper-based recordkeeping for that care may seem like their only option. (Because the information blocking definition references “electronic health information” rather than all “protected health information,” the information blocking regulations do not apply to health information maintained only in paper format.)</P>",
      "<P>A reversal to paper-based methods of keeping even a relatively small portion of the records currently managed using modern health IT would have an adverse effect on interoperability and on the development of a nationwide health IT infrastructure that does the things identified in section 3001(b) of the PHSA. Thus, such a reversal to paper-based recordkeeping methods would impede the goals of promoting public confidence in the electronic health information infrastructure and of advancing patient safety through the use of interoperable health IT and EHI. For example, information kept only on paper is not available to support tools that help clinicians avoid adverse drug events by automatically checking for potential drug-drug or drug-allergy interactions.</P>",
      "<P>For the reasons discussed above, we believe actors' practices of limiting EHI sharing under the conditions of the proposed § 171.206 exception are reasonable and necessary to preserve advances in digitization, interoperability, and public confidence in the nationwide health information technology infrastructure. Actors selectively withholding EHI that indicates or is potentially related to reproductive health care (as applicable) under the conditions of the proposed § 171.206 would also promote patient safety and improve outcomes by fostering trust between care providers and recipients. Maintaining advances and trust in the health information technology infrastructure fosters better care by continuing to make information available to more care providers and care recipients when and where the information can help them choose the right care for each patient (care recipient). Use of interoperable, electronic health IT and exchange of EHI also enables providers to use decision support tools, such as drug-drug interaction alerting, and to deliver better care.</P>",
      "<P>The proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) could apply in some circumstances where another exception (such as Preventing Harm (§ 171.201) or Privacy (§ 171.202)) would or could also apply. The proposed new exception is, however, intended to stand alone and independent of other. The proposed Protecting Care Access Exception would not affect if, how, or when any provision of any exception that does not explicitly reference § 171.206 applies to an actor's practice, or how any such provision operates. Moreover, where facts and circumstances were such that an actor could choose to shape their practice in withholding EHI to satisfy either the Protecting Care Access Exception (if finalized) or another exception, the actor would have discretion to choose which exception they wish to satisfy. An actor's practice in such situation(s) would not need to satisfy both exceptions in order for the practice to not be considered information blocking.</P>",
      "<P>One of the existing information blocking exceptions applicable in some circumstances where the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception could also apply is the Privacy Exception. Of particular relevance to actors' confidence that they will not be “information blocking” if they withhold EHI based on the individual's preference that their EHI be closely held is the Privacy Exception's sub-exception “respecting an individual's request not to share information” (§ 171.202(e)).</P>",
      "<P>This Privacy sub-exception is applicable where an actor agrees to honor an individual's request not to share their EHI even where it is permissible to share under all applicable law. We are proposing to strengthen and simplify that § 171.202(e) Privacy sub-exception as discussed in section IV.B.1.c of this proposed rule. The § 171.202(e) sub-exception offers actors certainty that they can, if they so choose, honor an individual's preference for restrictions on the sharing of EHI about the individual without subjecting the actor to an information blocking penalty or disincentive for not sharing such EHI. However, while the § 171.202(e) sub-exception does not rest on why the individual may prefer that some or all of their EHI not be shared, the § 171.202(e) sub-exception only applies to scenarios where the individual requests the restrictions. There may be circumstances where an individual does not request the restriction, but when it would be reasonable and necessary for actors to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for the purpose of addressing individuals' (let alone providers' and others') risk of potential exposure to legal action that could discourage availability, access, and choice of medically appropriate reproductive health care.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We believe it would be burdensome to individuals, in the constantly changing legal landscape, to rely exclusively on them to make or update requests for restrictions on their EHI that indicates or is potentially related to reproductive health care. In such a complex and uncertain environment, any individual may experience difficulty in making timely requests for such restrictions. Moreover, some individuals may not have the resources—such as affordable, secure access to the internet—to update their providers on their information sharing preferences outside of the occasions that they interact with these providers to obtain health care. Thus, individuals may not be able to request \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63632\"/>\n                        restrictions soon enough, or that are broad enough, to protect themselves or others from potential legal liability based on what care they have received.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>An individual's request for restrictions on sharing their EHI is specific and limited to that individual's EHI, and (depending on what the individual chooses to request) may be specific to identified requestors of the individual's EHI. Thus, it is not as efficient for actors to implement such individual restrictions as it would be to implement restrictions based on an organizational policy that consistently addresses a concern common to sharing any individuals' EHI in a particular access, exchange, or use scenario—such as the actor's good faith belief that there is a concern regarding the risk of potential exposure to legal action that could be created or increased by propagating to a recipient not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule the specific EHI within a patient's record that indicates the receipt of reproductive health care.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        For these reasons, we believe that health care providers and other actors must have available to them an information blocking exception designed to apply to practices that the actor believes could help to avoid creating—through sharing of EHI indicating or potentially related to reproductive health care in relevant scenarios—a risk of potential exposure to legal action based on the mere fact that lawful reproductive health care was sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated (or where the proposed \n                        <E T=\"03\">patient protection</E>\n                         condition would apply, because the EHI indicates patient health history or condition(s) for which reproductive health care is often sought, obtained, or medically indicated).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        When an actor has a belief consistent with the proposed § 171.206(a)(1) belief requirement, we believe an exception should be available that is designed to cover practices likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI under certain conditions.\n                        <SU>245</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Therefore, we propose in § 171.206 a new Protecting Care Access Exception from the information blocking definition. When its conditions are met, the new exception would cover an actor's practices that interfere with access, exchange or use of EHI in order to reduce potential exposure of applicable persons to legal action (as defined in the exception). For the proposed exception to apply, the potential exposure to legal action that the actor believes could be created must be one that would arise from the fact that reproductive health care was (or may have been) sought, obtained, provided, or facilitated rather than because the care provided was (or is alleged to have been) clinically inappropriate or otherwise substandard.\n                    </P>",

For example, the proposed exception would not invalidate otherwise valid court-ordered disclosures, or disclosures (for example, infectious disease, or child or elder abuse case reports) mandated by a Federal, State, or Tribal law with which an actor is required to comply in relevant circumstances. The exception is also not intended to justify an attempt to limit the legally required production of (otherwise discoverable) EHI in a civil, criminal, or administrative action that is brought in the jurisdiction where a health care provider provided health care that a patient (or their representative) alleges was negligent, defective, substandard, or otherwise tortious. Similarly, the exception would not apply to, and is not intended to justify, attempts to avoid disclosing information where the actor's belief is that the information could be useful to a legal action against the actor or other person specific to alleged violations of Federal or other law against conduct other than merely seeking, receiving, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care.

We are also interested in any thoughts or concerns commenters may have about the “good faith belief” standard and how such concerns could be mitigated by the addition to § 171.206 of a presumption that an actor's belief is held in good faith.</P>",
      "<P>To ensure we have flexibility to do so in case we determine it is the optimal approach after considering public comments on the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception, we propose in the alternative to do one or both of the following: (1) set “belief” or “honest belief” rather than “good faith belief” as the substantive standard in § 171.206(a); or (2) add to § 171.206 a provision for HHS to presume an actor's belief met the standard unless we have or find evidence that the actor's belief did not meet the standard at all relevant times (relevant times are those when the actor engaged in practices for which the actor seeks application of the exception).</P>",

We propose in the alternative to require that each actor rely only on their own good faith belief in order to implement practices covered by the Protecting Care Access Exception, including when an actor maintains EHI on behalf of other actor(s) or any other person(s).

The exception is not intended to apply to an actor's interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI based on an actor's belief that the practice would reduce any person's exposure to legal action or liability based on the conduct that was not the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, facilitating, or (where the \n                        <E T=\"03\">patient protection</E>\n                         condition applies, potentially needing) reproductive health care that was, under the circumstances in which the conduct occurred, unlawful.\n                    </P>",

To satisfy the § 171.206(a)(1) requirement, the actor's good faith belief would need to be that persons seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care “are at risk” of being potentially exposed to legal action. This does not mean that the exception would apply only where the actor is confident that legal action will follow from access, exchange, or use of EHI related to reproductive health care. “Are at risk” would simply mean that the risk the actor believes might arise as a consequence of the affected access, exchange, or use of EHI is one that could, to the best of the actor's knowledge and understanding, arise under law that is in place at the time the practice(s) that is based on the belief are implemented. Thus, the proposed § 171.206 exception would not apply to practices undertaken based on a hypothetical risk of exposure to legal action, such as one the actor postulates could perhaps become possible if applicable law(s) were to change in the future. Similarly, where an actor may believe a risk exists that someone could potentially be exposed to legal action but does not believe that a particular practice could achieve some reduction in that risk, the § 171.206(a)(1) requirement would not be met by (and therefore the § 171.206 exception would not apply to) that practice.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>Like similar provisions in other exceptions, this tailoring requirement ensures that the exception would not apply to an actor's practices likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of all of an individual's EHI when it is only portions of the EHI that the actor believes could create the type of risk recognized by the exception. Where only portion(s) of the EHI an actor has pertaining to one or more patients pose a risk of potentially exposing some person(s) to legal action, the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception would apply only to practices affecting particular access, exchange, or use of the specific portion(s) of the EHI that pose the risk.</P>",
      "<P>Data segmentation is important for exchanging sensitive health data (as noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25705) and for enabling access, exchange, and use of EHI (as noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule at 88 FR 23874). We are aware of external efforts to innovate and mature consensus technical standards, and we hope this will foster routine inclusion of increasingly advanced data segmentation capabilities in more EHR systems and other health IT over time.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        However, we have received public feedback (both prior to and in response to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule request for information on health IT capabilities for data segmentation and user/patient access at 88 FR 23874 through 23875) indicating that there is currently significant variability in health IT products' capabilities to segment data, such as to enable differing levels of access to data based on the user and purpose. We recognize there is a potential that some actors who may wish to withhold specific EHI under the conditions specified in the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) may not yet have the technical capability needed to unambiguously segment the EHI for which § 171.206 would apply from other EHI that they could lawfully make available for a particular access, exchange, or use.

We propose that any given practice could satisfy this implementation requirement in either of two ways. First, an actor could undertake the practice consistent with an organizational policy that meets the requirements proposed in § 171.206(a)(3)(i). To satisfy the proposed requirement in this first way, the organization's policy would need to identify the connection between the particular access, exchange, or use of the specific EHI with which the practice interferes and the risk of potential exposure to legal action that the actor believes could be created by such access, exchange, or use. The policy would also need to be:\n                    </P>",

      "<P>In order to ensure each practice implemented pursuant to the policy applies only to the particular access, exchange, or use scenario(s) to which at least one of the conditions in paragraphs (b) or (c) of § 171.206 is applicable, a policy would need to specify the facts and circumstances under which it would apply a practice. Such specifications need not be particularized to individual patients but would need to identify with sufficient clarity for the actor's employees and business associates (or other contractors, as applicable) to accurately apply the practice only to relevant access, exchange, or use scenarios. The types of facts or circumstances the policy might need to specify may vary, but we believe might often include such details as to what EHI (such as what value set(s) within what data element(s)) and to what scenario(s) of access, exchange, or use the policy will apply to a practice.</P>",

However, we do not propose to limit the application of the exception to any specific value set(s). Because version updates of such value sets, or new value sets, may develop more rapidly than adoption or reference of them in regulations could occur, we believe the intended operation of the exception will be best served by leaving actors flexibility to identify, document in their organizational policy or case-by-case determination(s), and then use whatever value set(s) comport with their belief that a risk of potential exposure to legal action (consistent with the exception's conditions) could be created or increased by sharing specific EHI indicating or (where the \n                        <E T=\"03\">patient protection</E>\n                         condition applies) potentially related to reproductive health care.\n                    </P>",

To satisfy paragraph (a)(3)(ii), any case-by-case determination would need to be made in the absence of an organizational policy applicable to the particular situation and be based on facts and circumstances known to, or believed in good faith by, the actor at the time of the determination. A practice implemented based on the determination must also be tailored to reduce the risk of legal action the actor has a good faith belief could result from access, exchange, or use of the EHI. And the practice must be no broader than necessary to reduce the risk of potential exposure to legal action (paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)).\n                    </P>",

By identifying the connection or relationship, this documentation would explain what risk the actor believes the practice(s) will mitigate.</P>",
      "<P>The proposed § 171.206(a)(3) implementation requirement's optionality would support the actor's interest in having flexibility to address both relatively stable and more dynamic facts and circumstances. Each of the options is intended to balance this interest of the actor with the interests of others, including the actor's current and potential competitors, in ensuring that any information blocking exception does not apply to practices that are not necessary for the specific purpose(s) the exception is designed to serve. The subparagraph (a)(3)(i) organizational policy provision would allow actors to apply relevant expertise available at the time of creating and updating organizational policies to craft a policy that suits their circumstances (such as technological capabilities and staffing and the types of scenarios they have experienced or expect to experience, perhaps with some regularity). The case-by-case determination provision (sub-paragraph (a)(3)(ii)) ensures the proposed exception would be available for all actors across the full array of facts and circumstances they may encounter, including unanticipated ones.</P>",

To the extent the actor has such other EHI that the actor can (both legally and technically) make available for any and all permissible purposes, we would expect the actor to do so.

For example, under this first proposed potential added restriction on applicability of § 171.206(c), a delay of an individual's access, exchange, or use of EHI that would rise to the level of an “interference” for purposes of the “information blocking” definition in § 171.103 that satisfied all other requirements of § 171.206(a) and (c) would be covered by the § 171.206 exception only to the extent the delay of the individual's (or their personal representative's) access to EHI did not exceed the maximum time permitted, in the specific circumstances, for fulfillment of access to PHI under 45 CFR 164.524. (Coverage of an exception would be irrelevant for a delay not rising to the level of an “interference” because § 171.103 focuses on practices not required by law that are likely to “interfere with” access, exchange, or use of EHI.) This proposed restriction to practices not violating § 164.524 would also mean § 171.206 would apply where an actor's interference involved offering fewer manners of access, exchange, or use than would be feasible for the actor to support, but only to the extent that the actor's limiting the manners in which EHI is made available would not constitute a violation under 45 CFR 164.524.

      "<P>\n                        We propose as a second (again, non-exclusive) alternative to include in the proposed \n                        <E T=\"03\">care access</E>\n                         condition (§ 171.206(c)) an additional requirement that would be applicable specifically if an actor chooses to engage in a practice of delaying fulfillment of requests for EHI access, exchange, or use by individuals (as defined in § 171.202(a)(2)) because the actor wants to provide, in a non-discriminatory manner, information to the individual relevant to the actor's good faith belief that a risk of potential exposure to legal action could be created by the individual's choice of how to receive their EHI or to whom the individual wishes to direct their EHI. For example, an actor that is also a HIPAA covered entity would, under § 164.524, be required to fulfill an individual's request for access to PHI or to transmit to a third party an electronic copy of the individual's PHI in an EHR within the time period required under § 164.524. \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63638\"/>\n                        Where the § 171.206 exception would apply and the third party is not a covered entity or business associate, the actor may wish to first provide the individual with information (that is, to the best of the actor's knowledge and belief, accurate and factual) about the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules and differences in their applicability to EHI when it is not held by a HIPAA covered entity or business associate in comparison to when it is. Similarly, an actor might wish to communicate such information to an individual before enabling access, exchange, or use of EHI for a health care provider that is not a HIPAA covered entity or business associate. The actor might, for example, be concerned that the individual may not have previously obtained or been provided basic information about how the applicability of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to information held by or for a provider that is not a HIPAA covered entity may differ from the rule's application to the same information when it is held by or for entities regulated under HIPAA. The actor may wish to provide the individual such information so that the individual would have a fair opportunity to consider the possible privacy risks. In such situations, the actor may be concerned about potential information blocking implications of the delay that is necessary to provide the individual with information. Or the actor may be concerned with the delay that results when an individual (or their personal representative) is considering the information before confirming they want the actor to proceed with enabling the application the individual (or their personal representative) has chosen to receive the EHI of which the individual is a subject. Specifically, the actor may be concerned these delays could rise to the level of an “interference” and, therefore, implicate the information blocking definition even if the time required is less than the maximum time permitted to fulfill PHI access under 45 CFR 164.524 in the relevant circumstances.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Therefore, we are considering the second proposed additional a requirement for § 171.206. This second potential additional requirement would apply where an actor's practice delays making EHI available upon individual request or directive in order to provide individuals with non-biased general information about relevant laws or about the actor's belief that is consistent with § 171.206(a)(1)(i), the delay must be of no longer duration than is reasonably necessary to provide to the individual two things:</P>",
      "<P>(1) honest information that is provided in a non-discriminatory manner and that is relevant to the actor's belief that a risk of potential exposure to legal action could be created by the particular access, exchange, and use of what specific EHI, such as general information about privacy laws or other laws that the actor believes may be relevant; and</P>",
      "<P>(2) a reasonable opportunity to consider the information and seek additional information from other sources if the individual would like, before the individual is asked to either confirm or revise any specifics of their request for access, exchange, or use of their EHI.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Under this alternative proposal specific to delaying a response to a right of access request (including the right to direct a HIPAA covered entity to transmit to a third party an electronic copy of the individual's PHI in an EHR), delays longer than reasonably necessary to provide the individual with information relevant to the actor's belief that is consistent with § 171.206(a)(1) and allow the individual to consider the actor's information and seek information from additional source(s) (if the individual desires) would not satisfy the § 171.206(c) \n                        <E T=\"03\">care access</E>\n                         condition. This proposed restriction that is specific to delays for the purpose of informing individuals of an actor's belief that sharing specific EHI could create risk of potential exposure to legal action could be implemented regardless of whether we also implement a requirement that, for the \n                        <E T=\"03\">care access</E>\n                         condition or for the \n                        <E T=\"03\">threshold</E>\n                         condition to be met by an actor's practice, the practice must not constitute a violation of § 164.524. This potential additional requirement would limit the applicability of the condition in scenarios where an actor might choose to engage in delay to provide individuals with information about potential privacy consideration, but should not be construed as creating an affirmative requirement for any actor to delay fulfillment of individual access requests to provide individuals with information about potential privacy implications of the individual's request. We reiterate that information blocking exceptions are voluntary.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We reiterate that even in scenarios where an actor's denial of access, exchange, or use of EHI might not be “information blocking” because it satisfies an exception under and for purposes of part 171, an actor that is a HIPAA covered entity or business associate will still need to comply with 45 CFR 164.524 (individual right of access). (This is true of the exceptions codified in subparts B, C, and D of 45 CFR part 171 as of the date of publication of this proposed rule and would also be true of the new exceptions proposed in this rule in the event any of them are finalized.)</P>",
      "<P>The additional requirement(s) we are considering, and as noted above propose in the alternative, would seek to more finely tune the exception's balance of the interests of actors and patients in protecting reproductive health care availability by mitigating legal risks for the people who provide that care, and for the people who facilitate the provision of such care, with the interests of individuals in being able to access, exchange, and use all of their EHI however and whenever they want, and to share all of their EHI however and with whomever they choose, at no cost for “electronic access” as defined in § 171.302(d).

      "<P>For purposes of determining whether an actor's practice meets paragraph § 171.206(b)(1)(i) or § 171.206(c), we propose in § 171.206(d) that care furnished by someone other than the actor would be presumed to be lawful unless the actor has actual knowledge that the care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. The presumption provision proposed in § 171.206(d) is similar to the presumption provision finalized (in 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)(C)) by the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule, but is necessarily different because of differences in how the prohibition at 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)(A) operates and how the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) is intended to operate.</P>",
      "<P>First, the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) would be voluntary. It would offer those actors who may wish to engage in practices likely to interfere with EHI access, exchange, or use under the exception's conditions certainty that practices satisfying the exception will not be considered “information blocking.” Nothing in § 171.206 is intended to create an affirmative obligation for any actor to evaluate whether the Protecting Care Access Exception might apply to any access, exchange, or use of EHI for permissible purposes.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Second, the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) is based on statutory authority found in section 3022 of PHSA to identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking for purposes of the PHSA 3022 definition of the term. We do not propose that \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63639\"/>\n                        anything in § 171.206 would operate to override an actor's obligation to comply with another (applicable) law that requires the actor to make EHI available for any permissible purpose. Thus, an actor may still be compelled to disclose EHI in compliance with such other law even where the exception might mean an actor's failure to comply with such other law would not be considered “information blocking” under 45 CFR part 171 or PHSA 3022. (The exception would not be relevant where an actor is also a HIPAA covered entity or business associate would be required to comply with the prohibition at 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii) because a HIPAA covered entity's or business associate's practice of refusing to make a use or disclosure of PHI prohibited by the HIPAA Privacy Rule is “required by law” and therefore not information blocking to begin with.)\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Finally, a policy goal of the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception is that it be easy for any actor to confidently and efficiently meet the conditions of the proposed exception. One way the exception's structure supports this goal is by providing (in § 171.206(a)(3)(i)) for the actor to implement practices per organizational policies that address particular types of EHI sharing scenarios where the actor believes the risk of potential exposure to legal action could be created even if the actor has not yet received a request for EHI for the activities specified in 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)(A) or any of the purposes specified in 45 CFR 164.512(d), (e), (f), or (g)(1) for which the attestations specified in 45 CFR 164.509 would be required as a precondition for disclosing PHI potentially related to reproductive health care to be permitted under the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        As noted elsewhere, an actor's practice satisfying the new exception would mean the practice will not be considered information blocking. To the extent that EHI indicates or potentially relates to reproductive health care that was not lawful under the specific circumstances in which it was provided, we presume that the legal authority compelling disclosure of EHI for such purposes would have its own enforcement provisions independent of the penalties and disincentives authorized by PHSA 3022 for an actor determined by the HHS OIG to have committed information blocking. Because exception would not exempt the actor from their obligation to comply with such other law, we do not believe it is necessary to preserve the potential for information blocking penalties to apply in addition to any consequences that might attach under such other law to an actor's non-compliance with that law. On the other hand, we believe it is important to ensure that concern about information blocking consequences would not prevent the actor from, for example, delaying fulfillment of a demand for EHI in order to review factual information supplied by the requestor and determine whether that information “demonstrates a substantial factual basis” (as stated in 45 CFR 164. 502(a)(5)(iii)(C)(2)) and, by extension, whether the 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule or applicable State law permits, preempts, or conflicts with the law the requestor indicates compels the actor to make the EHI available to the requestor.\n                        <SU>252</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                    </P>",

Please \n                            <E T=\"03\">see</E>\n                             § 171.202(b) and discussion in HTI-1 final rule (at 89 FR 1351 through 1354) of how information blocking exception work in concert with the HIPAA Rules and other privacy laws to support health information privacy.\n                        </P>\n                    </FTNT>",
      "<P>We are, moreover, concerned that tying the proposed § 171.206(d) presumption provision to the requestor not supplying information demonstrating a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the specific circumstances in which it was provided would make the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception (§ 171.206) more difficult for actors to use and therefore could discourage actors from using it. We are concerned this difficulty could discourage use of the exception particularly by those actors—such as small and safety net health care providers or non-profit health information networks who serve them—who may have limited ability to divert resources to these types of legal analyses, especially in circumstances where this exception is intended to apply but the request for EHI access, exchange, or use may not be coming from a law enforcement entity and the access, exchange, or use of EHI sought may not be for a law enforcement purpose.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in the alternative to add to § 171.206(d), if finalized, a provision that parallels the provision in 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(iii)(C)(2) and that would prevent the § 171.206(d) presumption from applying where factual information supplied by the person requesting access, exchange, or use of EHI demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the specific circumstances in which it was provided. We welcome comments on this alternative proposal. We are particularly interested in whether and why actors, patients, and other interested parties may believe § 171.206(d) would strike a better balance between actors' interests in a simpler, more easily usable exception and requestors' interests in obtaining EHI for permissible purposes with or without the additional limit on application of the presumption provision.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose in § 171.206(e) to define “legal action” for purposes of the Protecting Care Access Exception. Under the proposed definition, “legal action” would include any of the following when initiated or pursued against any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care: (1) civil, criminal, or administrative investigation; (2) a civil or criminal action brought in a court to impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability; or (3) an administrative action or proceeding against any person. We emphasize that the proposed Protecting Care Access Exception would apply where an actor's practice meets the § 171.206(a) \n                        <E T=\"03\">threshold</E>\n                         condition and at least one of the other two conditions in the exception, none of which would require the actor to quantify a degree, amount, or probability of the risk of potential exposure to legal action the actor believes in good faith exists and could be reduced by the practice to which § 171.206 applies.\n                    </P>",

      "<P>We propose a new exception, “Requestor Preferences,” in § 171.304 to offer actors certainty that, under the conditions specified in this exception, it would not be considered “information blocking” to honor a requestor's preferences expressed or confirmed in writing for: (1) limitations on the scope of EHI made available to the requestor; (2) the conditions under which EHI is made available to the requestor; and (3) the timing of when EHI is made available to the requestor for access, exchange, or use.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Since publication of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, actors have indicated a preference for greater certainty as to the conditions under which they would not be committing information blocking if they were to honor certain preferences expressed by a requestor seeking lawful \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63640\"/>\n                        access, exchange, or use of EHI. In some instances, this preference might be that some type(s) of new EHI are not made available as quickly as would be technically feasible or that a more limited scope of EHI is made available than would be permitted (or required) under applicable law based on whose EHI the requestor seeks and for what purpose(s). For example, actors have indicated that they are uncertain of the scenarios when honoring an individual's request for delay of EHI availability to the individual in the patient portal would not be information blocking. Actors have also indicated that they are unable to honor a health care provider's expressed preference to receive only some of the EHI that an actor has and could disclose to the provider under applicable law, because the actor is uncertain whether honoring the health care provider's preference would be considered information blocking. The proposed exception (new § 171.304) would address these concerns by providing certainty of the conditions under which we would not consider an actor to engage in information blocking when the actor honors a requestor's preference to: (1) receive only a subset of EHI (limitation on scope of EHI), (2) have the EHI be available to the requestor only under specific timing or other conditions, or (3) any combination of such preferences.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We recognize that, sometimes, a requestor who seeks access, exchange, or use of EHI may prefer to have less EHI available to the requestor than an actor has and would be permitted to make available under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (and any other applicable law(s) restricting uses and disclosures of an individual's health information to protect the individual's privacy). We also recognize that sometimes a requestor may not want particular EHI to be available to the requestor immediately, perhaps preferring the EHI not be available until a certain period of time has elapsed or until certain conditions are met. For example, an individual who uses a patient portal or app to access EHI of which they are the subject may not want certain test results to be available in that patient portal or app for a certain number of hours or until the next business day (timing preference). Similarly, an individual may not want the results of certain diagnostic tests performed on the individual to be available to the individual in a patient portal or app until the doctor who ordered the test(s) has seen the results or until a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional is available who can explain what the results mean (conditions for making EHI available preference). For a provider-to-provider example, a primary-care clinician office (requestor) may ask that for laboratory tests done more than once during a patient's stay at a hospital, the hospital (actor) only send the clinician office the results from the last time each test was done (scope of EHI preference), and only send that EHI to the clinician office upon the patient's discharge from the hospital stay (a preference for the conditions under which EHI becomes available). As another provider-to-provider example, a health care provider (requestor) might ask another health care provider (actor) to not send all of the medication history the responding actor has for a patient that the actor is legally permitted to share with the requesting health care provider. The requestor might ask the responding actor to send instead only the patient's current medications and known allergies. The proposed exception (to be codified in § 171.304) would address all of these examples and a variety of other situations. The proposed exception (§ 171.304) has four separate conditions: (a) \n                        <E T=\"03\">request;</E>\n                         (b) \n                        <E T=\"03\">implementation,</E>\n                         (c) \n                        <E T=\"03\">transparency;</E>\n                         and (d) \n                        <E T=\"03\">reduction or removal.</E>\n                         In order for an actor's practice(s) to satisfy the proposed Requestor Preferences Exception (§ 171.304), the practice(s) would have to meet all four of the conditions at all relevant times.\n                    </P>",

This condition is similar to our approach under the Privacy Exception (§ 171.202) for obtaining a patient's consent under sub-exception (b), which cannot be satisfied if the actor improperly encourages or induces the individual to withhold consent or authorization. It is also similar to a provision of the Privacy Exception's sub-exception (e), which can be satisfied only if the individual requests that the actor not provide such access, exchange, or use of EHI without any improper encouragement or inducement of the request by the actor. In addition to disqualifying an actor's practices in response to such requests from application of the proposed Requestor Preferences Exception, we remind actors that any improper inducement of a patient's or other person's request for delay or other restrictions on a requestor's access to EHI is a practice that, on its own, could constitute an interference that implicates the information blocking definition.\n                    </P>",

This requirement is intended to guard against the inappropriate citation of the exception to retroactively “justify” the actor's limitation of a requestor's access, exchange, and use of EHI to suit the \n                        <E T=\"03\">actor's</E>\n                         preferences.

In this condition, “tailored to the specific request” means the practice is no broader than necessary to do, and in fact does, what the requestor asked for in writing. The § 171.304(b) \n                        <E T=\"03\">implementation</E>\n                         condition would also require (see subparagraph (2)) that the request be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This requirement parallels similar requirements in existing exceptions, such as the Preventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201(f)(1)(iii)), Privacy Exception (§ 171.202(b)(1), (c)(3) and (3)), and the Security Exception (§ 171.203(c)). For purposes of § 171.304, discriminatory implementation practices would include, for example, the actor moving more slowly to modify or remove tailoring restrictions (see proposed condition (d)) from access, exchange, or use of EHI based on whether the requestor is a business competitor of the actor or if the requestor's access, exchange, or use of EHI is likely to facilitate competition with the actor. As innovation in biomedical informatics \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63641\"/>\n                        and health IT advances, we anticipate that the EHI a requestor needs or wants to inform decisions related to seeking or accepting healthcare, or for public health activities or providing or paying for healthcare may change. Therefore, a requestor's preferences for restrictions on the amount of EHI or the conditions or timing of EHI availability to the requestor (or any combination of these) may well change over time. The requirement that the actor's practice be consistent and non-discriminatory is intended, for example, to ensure the exception will not apply to practices that are implemented in a manner that disadvantages competitors, potential competitors, or persons whose access, exchange, or use of EHI may facilitate competition with the actor in comparison to persons who are affiliates or whose access, exchange, or use of EHI would not be expected to facilitate competition with the actor.\n                    </P>",

For example, to the surprise of the requestor, the tailoring of EHI ended up being more or less restrictive than what the requestor thought they agreed to. The risk of surprise to the requestor may arise either when a requestor first asks for tailoring or when an actor may no longer be able to maintain certain tailoring that they have previously agreed to implement in response to a requestor's ask. To mitigate the risk of surprise to a requestor, it is important for a requestor who has asked for tailoring to be informed of what the actor can and will do, or cannot or will not continue to do.

We also are not suggesting that we believe an actor's agreement to tailor when, how much, or under what conditions EHI becomes available to any given requestor should be treated as establishing a contract or binding agreement.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        To meet the requirement in subparagraph (1) of § 171.304(c), an actor would be required to explain to the requestor what they can and will do to tailor EHI availability to the requestor. Meeting subparagraph (2) of § 171.304(c) would require an actor who experiences a change in operational status or technical capabilities affecting the actor's ability to maintain tailoring to make “reasonable efforts” to promptly notify each requestor for whom the actor had implemented affected tailoring. We have used the “reasonable efforts” standard in the existing \n                        <E T=\"03\">precondition not satisfied</E>\n                         sub-exception of the Privacy Exception (see § 171.202(b)(2)(i)). As we stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule preamble discussion of the finalized § 171.202(b), a “reasonable efforts” standard aligns with the case-by-case approach that is captured in the statutory information blocking provision (see 85 FR 25852). Similar to the “reasonable efforts” standard in § 171.202(b)(2)(i), the “reasonable efforts” standard in the proposed § 171.304(c)(2) would be met if the actor used reasonable efforts within its control to promptly provide the requestor with notice of the change in the actor's ability or willingness to continue applying the tailoring of EHI availability to the requestor that the requestor had requested, and the actor had implemented or agreed to implement. (We refer those who would like to read more about the “reasonable efforts” standard in context of the existing § 171.202(b)(2)(i) to the preamble discussion of the finalized § 171.202(b)(2)(i) at 85 FR 25852).\n                    </P>",

This requirement, like the use of “plain language” rather than “plain writing” as a standard for the explanations and notices, leaves flexibility for actors to communicate with requestors in writing, verbally, or in other ways that are efficient and effective for both the actor and requestor or otherwise mutually agreeable to them. Contemporaneous written documentation of explanations and notices not provided (initially made or later confirmed) to the requestor in writing would enable the actor to demonstrate what explanation or notice they provided and when. Contemporaneous written records of notices made or attempted would also be relevant, where notice fails to reach the requestor or the requestor does not recall details of the notice, to the actor's demonstration of the efforts the actor made to provide notice consistent with § 171.304(c)(2).\n                    </P>",

For the actor's practices restricting a requestor's access, exchange, or use of EHI based on the requestor's request to remain covered by this proposed exception when the requestor asks for reduction or removal of restrictions, the \n                        <E T=\"03\">reduction or removal</E>\n                         condition (§ 171.304(d)) would require the actor to act promptly as feasible on that request.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        We do not propose to set a specific timeframe within which an actor would need to act on requests to reduce or remove restrictions upon receipt of any such request from the requestor.

Basing this requirement on what is feasible for the actor allows for consideration of the specific facts and circumstances under which the actor received the request. We believe this is preferable to setting a single fixed timeframe due to the considerable variation in actors' technical capabilities and operational circumstances at any given point in time. However, we recognize that actors and individuals may find some value in consistent maximum timeframe expectations for acting on a requestor's ask for removal or reduction of previously requested restrictions on their access, exchange, or use of EHI in individual access scenarios. (By “individual access scenarios,” we mean here those where the requestor is either: (a) the individual \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63642\"/>\n                        who is the subject of the EHI in question; or (b) their legal representative, including, but not limited to, personal representatives treated as the individual consistent with 45 CFR 164.502(g)). Therefore, we are considering specifying in § 171.304(d) that the maximum time any actor would have to reduce or remove the tailoring in any individual access scenario would be the time within which a HIPAA covered entity must provide an individual (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) or their personal representative (see 45 CFR 164.524(g)) access to PHI in the designated record set under 45 CFR 164.524. Under this alternative proposal, the “as promptly as feasible” standard would apply to all other requestor scenarios without a specified maximum limit on the time an actor could take; but meeting the proposed § 171.304(d) \n                        <E T=\"03\">reduction or removal</E>\n                         condition in individual access scenarios would require the actor to reduce or remove restrictions in response to the requestor's request as promptly as feasible but in no case later than the maximum time permitted to fulfill individual access requests under 45 CFR 164.524. (This is an alternative proposal that is not reflected in the draft of § 171.304 in the “Regulatory Text” section of this proposed rule.) This alternative proposal for § 171.304(d) requirements would apply to individual access scenarios regardless of whether 45 CFR 164.524 would, in any given scenario, be implicated (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         even if the actor were not a HIPAA covered entity or business associate).\n                    </P>",

For purposes of the § 171.304 exception under this alternative proposal, the time for responding to a request for reduction or removal of EHI access, exchange, or use tailoring in individual access scenarios would start on the date on which the actor receives the individual's (or their legal representative's) request for reduction or removal of tailoring. We would craft this additional requirement in this manner specifically so that, in the event the 45 CFR 164.524 timeliness standard were to change in the future (\n                        <E T=\"03\">see,</E>\n                         for example, the proposal to modify that standard at 86 FR 6459 and 6535), the § 171.304(d) condition would apply the same timeframe in effect for 45 CFR 164.524 at the point in time when an individual who is the subject of the EHI (or their legal representative) requested removal or reduction of restrictions on the individual's (or the legal representative's) EHI access. Such requests are, effectively, the requestor requesting their EHI be made available more promptly or completely than they had previously requested it be available to them. For clarity, once the reduction or removal of tailoring is complete for purposes of this proposed exception, all future requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI previously affected by the reduced or removed tailoring could implicate the interference and information blocking definition particularly §§ 171.103 and 171.104 (new proposed section).\n                    </P>",

      "<P>\n                        As briefly discussed above, we finalized a new TEFCA Manner Exception in the HTI-1 Final Rule. We stated that the new TEFCA Manner Exception (§ 171.403) provides that an actor's practice of limiting the manner in which it fulfills a request to access, exchange, or use EHI to be providing such access, exchange, or use to only via TEFCA will not be considered information blocking when it follows certain conditions (89 FR 1388). Those conditions require that (1) the actor and requestor both be part of TEFCA; (2) that \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63643\"/>\n                        the requestor is capable of such access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI from the actor via TEFCA; and (3) any fees charged by the actor and the terms for any license of interoperability elements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the request are required to satisfy, respectively, the Fees Exception (§ 171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303). In addition to these three requirements, we also included a limitation in § 171.403(c), stating that the exception is available only if the request is not made via the standards adopted in 45 CFR 170.215, which include the FHIR API standards.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        Our finalized TEFCA Manner Exception differed from the proposed \n                        <E T=\"03\">TEFCA manner</E>\n                         condition in two ways. First, when we proposed the \n                        <E T=\"03\">TEFCA manner</E>\n                         condition, we stated that the Fees Exception and the Licensing Exceptions would not apply, because “we mistakenly assumed that all actors participating in TEFCA would have \n                        <E T=\"03\">already</E>\n                         reached overarching agreements on fees and licensing such that there would be no need for application of the Fees and Licensing Exceptions (See 88 FR 23872)” (89 FR 1389). We believe that by soliciting comments specifically on this point we provided notice to parties that we either would or would not apply the Fees and Licensing Exceptions. In response to our proposal, some commenters expressed concern that because the Common Agreement prohibits fees between QHINs\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                         but is otherwise silent on fees between Participants and Subparticipants, the proposal could allow actors to charge fees to access, exchange, or use EHI that did not comply with the Fees or Licensing Exceptions. Some commenters also expressed that this could have the effect of disincentivizing participation in TEFCA, and could cause actors to use other options of electronic exchange outside of TEFCA, where the actors believed the Fees and Licensing Exceptions would apply. As such, in the HTI-1 Final Rule, we finalized the TEFCA Manner Exception to include that any fees charged by the actor, and any licensing of interoperability elements, must satisfy the Fees Exception (§ 171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303) (89 FR 1389). While we continue to believe that it was clear that the alternative would be \n                        <E T=\"03\">to</E>\n                         apply the exceptions, we are requesting comment now on whether there are drawbacks to applying the Fees and Licensing Exceptions, and if we should continue to apply them to the TEFCA Manner Exception as currently required in § 171.403(d).\n                    </P>",

We finalized this limitation in response to comments noting that a request could be made for access, exchange, or use via FHIR-based API and an actor could respond in a different manner and satisfy the exception (89 FR 1390 through 91). Commenters further noted that this potential outcome could undermine our stated purpose in incentivizing TEFCA participation with the new exception (See 89 FR 1390). We now solicit comment on this limitation within the TEFCA Manner Exception for requests via FHIR API standards. For example, should the limitation be expanded to include exchange based on versions of the FHIR standards that are more advanced than those adopted in 45 CFR 170.215 or approved through the 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8) “Standards Version Advancement Process—voluntary updates of certified health IT to newer versions of standards and implementation specifications”? Currently, the limitation would only cover requests made via FHIR API standards codified in § 170.215, including standards that may be updated from time to time through § 170.405(b)(8), which may involve a delay before the version is formally approved under Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP).\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We also seek comment on a different approach. Eventually all TEFCA QHINs will be required to support exchange via FHIR API standards. A Participant or Subparticipant who makes a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI via FHIR API will at first make such a request through a QHIN, but in time, a Participant or Subparticipant could directly request access, exchange, or use of EHI via FHIR API standards from another Participant or Subparticipant in a different QHIN. One option would be to sunset the limitation in § 171.403(c) once all QHINs can support brokered FHIR. Another option would be to sunset the limitation in § 171.403(c) if all QHINs, Participants and Subparticipants support facilitated FHIR exchange. As an alternative to these options, we could maintain the exception as is, regardless of FHIR API adoption among TEFCA entities. We request comment on all of the options, including whether or not the limitation should remain as it is currently.</P>"

QHINs have significant organizational and technical capabilities, facilitate exchange at the highest level of the TEFCA infrastructure, and are the entities with which Participants (and their Subparticipants) interact in order to engage in TEFCA Exchange. “TEFCA Exchange,” which we propose to define in § 172.102, means the transaction of electronic protected health information (ePHI) between Nodes \n                        <SU>255</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         using a TEFCA-specific purpose of use code, meaning a code that identifies the Exchange Purpose for which exchange is occurring.

These regulations would further our obligations to “support” TEFCA under sections 3001(c)(9)(A) and (B) of the PHSA. The provisions included in this proposed rule would establish the qualifications for health information networks to receive and maintain Designation as a QHIN capable of trusted exchange pursuant to TEFCA, as well as establish procedures governing QHIN Onboarding and Designation, suspension, termination, and administrative appeals to ONC as described in the sections below. We believe establishing these provisions in regulation would strengthen the trust of interested parties in TEFCA and support its success at scale.</P>"

      "<P>For the purposes of subpart A, we propose in § 172.100 the basis, purpose, and scope for the proposed TEFCA provisions in part 172 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. We propose in § 172.100(a) that the basis for these provisions would be to implement section 3001(c)(9) of the PHSA (42 U.S.C 300jj-11(c)(9)). We propose in § 172.100(b) the dual purposes of proposed part 172: (1) to ensure full network-to-network exchange of health information; and (2) to establish a voluntary process for QHINs to attest to adoption of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement. Section 172.100(b)(1) supports the statutory basis because the organizational and operational policies covered by part 172 would enable the exchange of health information among health information networks using the common set of rules found in these regulations. Section 172.100(b)(2) supports the statutory basis because it implements PHSA § 3001(c)(9)(D). We propose in § 172.100(c) the scope for part 172, which would include: (1) minimum qualifications needed to be Designated as a QHIN capable of trusted exchange under TEFCA; (2) procedures governing QHIN Onboarding and Designation, suspension, termination, and further administrative review; (3) attestation submission requirements for a QHIN to attest to its adoption of TEFCA; and (4) ONC attestation acceptance and removal processes for publication of the list of attesting QHINs in the QHIN Directory. In proposed § 172.101, we specify the applicability of part 172 by proposing that part 172 would apply only to Applicant QHINs, QHINs, and terminated QHINs. We note that our proposed QHIN definition in § 172.102 captures suspended QHINs (since a suspended QHIN is still a QHIN) and so we do not address them separately in proposed § 172.101. In § 172.102, we propose definitions for certain terms in part 172. We intend for the definitions provided in the Common Agreement to be consistent with these proposed definitions. Differences in phrasing would generally be attributable to differences in context, though in the case of any true conflict, we would intend for the regulatory definitions to control.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Additionally, ONC has hired a contractor to help administer and implement TEFCA Exchange. This contractor, chosen through a competitive solicitation, is known as the Recognized Coordinating Entity® (RCE\n                        <SU>TM</SU>\n                        ). While the RCE is currently one entity, in the future, ONC may choose to assign some or all of its responsibilities to a different entity or multiple entities. Assigning to a different or multiple entities in the future could, for example, allow for more efficient use of resources or best leverage expertise. In § 172.103, “Responsibilities ONC may delegate to the RCE,” we propose that ONC may assign certain responsibilities to such an entity or entities for these purposes. Specifically, we propose in § 172.103(a)(1)-(4) that ONC may assign any of its responsibilities in Subpart C—QHIN Onboarding and Designation Process; Subpart D—Suspension, § 172.501 QHIN self-termination, and § 172.503 Termination by mutual agreement. In § 172.103(b), we propose that any authority exercised by the RCE under this section is subject to review by ONC under Subpart F (“Review of RCE Decisions”). For further discussion of the current RCE and the authority it exercises on behalf of ONC, please see the discussion in “\n                        <E T=\"03\">C.

      "<P>\n                        In subpart B, we propose qualifications for Designation. In § 172.200, we propose to tie QHIN status to meeting the requirements specified in § 172.201. We propose that an Applicant QHIN (as we propose to define it in § 172.102) would need to meet all requirements in § 172.201 to be \n                        <E T=\"03\">Designated,</E>\n                         and a QHIN would need to continue to meet all requirements in § 172.201 to \n                        <E T=\"03\">maintain its Designation.</E>\n                         That means that the requirements we propose in § 172.201 would be ongoing; a QHIN that does not meet those requirements at all times would be subject to suspension or termination, consistent with the regulations we propose in subparts D and E of part 172. Among other benefits, the continuing obligation to meet the requirements in § 172.201 would help to ensure the reliability of TEFCA Exchange and to ensure QHINs could not maintain their status based on technology and standards that have become obsolete. Because the obligations would be \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63645\"/>\n                        ongoing, throughout this section we refer to Applicant QHINs as well as Designated QHINs as “QHINs” unless there is a need to differentiate.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>As we explain below, the Designation qualifications proposed in § 172.201 would describe certain requirements for Designation. For an entity to become a QHIN, that entity must sign the Common Agreement, thus memorializing its agreement to the comprehensive Designation requirements—as well as other requirements—for trusted exchange under TEFCA. The comprehensive Designation requirements in the Common Agreement correspond to the proposed requirements included in this subpart.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201, we propose Designation requirements in three categories: (a) ownership; (b) exchange requirements; and (c) Designated Network Services.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In § 172.201(a), we propose the ownership requirements. In § 172.201(a)(1), we propose that a QHIN must be a U.S. Entity, as we propose to define \n                        <E T=\"03\">U.S. Entity/Entities</E>\n                         in § 172.102. Under that proposed definition, a U.S. Entity must be a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or other legal entity organized under the laws of a State or commonwealth of the United States or the Federal law of the United States, be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and the State or commonwealth under which it was formed, and have its principal place of business be in the United States under Federal law. Additionally, we propose that none of the entity's directors, officers, or executives, and none of the owners with a five percent (5%) or greater interest in the entity, may be listed on the \n                        <E T=\"03\">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List</E>\n                         published by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control or on the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities. This requirement would help to promote organizational and operational policies that enable the exchange of health information among networks by ensuring that those who actually control the health information exchanged under these provisions are subject to U.S. laws, and it would help to avoid giving access to that information to actors whom the government has previously identified as national security or fraud risks.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We request comment on whether the above approach, including the specific five percent (5%) threshold, will effectively limit access of bad actors trying to join TEFCA as a QHIN, or whether commenters believe the threshold should be a different percentage.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(a)(2), we propose that an Applicant QHIN must not be under Foreign Control, which is a term we propose to define in § 172.102. If, in the course of reviewing a QHIN application, ONC believes or has reason to believe the Applicant QHIN may be under Foreign Control, ONC will refer the case to the HHS Office of National Security (ONS) for review. If information available to ONS supports a determination of Foreign Control, ONS will notify ONC. An application will be denied if ONS notifies ONC that the Applicant is under Foreign Control. Given the scale of the responsibilities that a Designated QHIN would have with respect to supporting health information exchange and the importance that healthcare data has to the critical infrastructure of our nation's health care system, we believe that a QHIN should not be under Foreign Control. We believe the requirements proposed in § 172.201(a)(1) and (a)(2), in conjunction with the proposed definitions that those provisions reference, are necessary to ensure that all QHINs are subject to United States law and that compliance by QHINs is enforceable under United States law. Further, these proposals are designed to strengthen the security of the network. We believe that the above proposals promote organizational and operational policies that enable the exchange of health information among networks by minimizing the risk to TEFCA that may be posed by foreign state actors who wish to harm the United States, lessening the risks of subjecting QHINs to potentially conflicting foreign laws, and encouraging trust in the security of exchange under the system.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We note that within the proposed definition of \n                        <E T=\"03\">U.S. Entity/Entities</E>\n                         in § 172.102, we propose that for an entity seeking to become a QHIN to meet the definition, none of the entity's directors, officers, or executives, and none of the owners with a five percent (5%) or greater interest in the entity, can be listed on the \n                        <E T=\"03\">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List</E>\n                         published by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control or on the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities. We believe the five percent (5%) threshold strikes the right balance between protecting the security of the network from high-risk or known bad actors and achieving practical administrability of TEFCA. Individuals with less than five percent (5%) ownership in an entity would likely have limited means of influencing the actions of an entity connected to TEFCA. We believe that entities—particularly those with a large number of shareholders—would face undue hardship without this sort of exception for small shareholders. That said, this regulation only would provide the standard that ONC will apply when evaluating QHINs; it would not supersede any stricter requirements imposed by other applicable laws, including, for example national security laws. It remains the responsibility of QHINs (and any other entity) to comply with all applicable laws.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(b), we propose exchange requirements for QHINs. We believe these exchange requirements are necessary to build a data sharing infrastructure that is private and secure and that meets all the requirements of PHSA section 3001(c)(9). We believe each of the exchange requirements below is important to the implementation and operationalization of TEFCA Exchange, as described in § 172.201, at scale. We propose that an entity seeking to become a QHIN must, beginning at the time of application, either directly or through the experience of its parent entity, meet certain exchange requirements, including: (1) be capable of exchanging information among more than two unaffiliated organizations; (2) be capable of exchanging all Required Information (as that term is defined in § 172.102); (3) be exchanging information for at least one of the Exchange Purposes (as that term is defined in § 172.102) authorized, in the Common Agreement or an SOP(s) n; (4) be capable of receiving and responding to transactions from other QHINs for all Exchange Purposes; and (5) be capable of initiating transactions for the Exchange Purposes that such entity will permit its Participants and Subparticipants to use through TEFCA Exchange. Collectively, we believe these requirements are tailored to help ensure that a QHIN is capable of TEFCA Exchange, supports a trusted exchange framework, and maintains consistent practices of exchanging information at scale to support nationwide interoperability.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The first requirement, proposed in § 172.201(b)(1), that the entity seeking to become a QHIN be capable of exchanging information among more than two unaffiliated organizations, is a requirement that would ensure a minimum technical ability exists and that exchange would be enabled beyond just the QHIN itself.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63646\"/>\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        The second requirement, proposed in § 172.201(b)(2), is also a minimum condition, except it is directed at the minimum quantity of \n                        <E T=\"03\">data</E>\n                         a QHIN must be capable of exchanging. This proposed requirement would ensure that every QHIN can exchange Required Information (as that term is defined in § 171.102), and provides certainty to Participants and Subparticipants who seek to join a QHIN that there is a minimum scope of data that they can reliably expect to be able to exchange via TEFCA Exchange Purposes.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>The proposed requirements in § 172.201(b)(3) through (5) are intended to establish basic parameters and expectations for QHINs in order to qualify for Designation. We propose, in § 172.201(b)(3), that a QHIN or Applicant QHIN must be exchanging information for at least one Exchange Purpose.</P>",
      "<P>If a QHIN is not exchanging information for at least one of the Exchange Purposes authorized under TEFCA (for examples, see the “Exchange Purpose” definition in § 172.102) at the time of application, it is not meeting a minimum condition necessary for such exchange to occur and cannot be Designated. While exchange for an Exchange Purpose under TEFCA requires an Exchange Purpose Code, Applicant QHINs can demonstrate that they are meeting the requirement to exchange information for at least one of the Exchange Purposes by conducting exchange for an Exchange Purpose without use of an Exchange Purpose Code.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.201(b)(4) to require a QHIN to be capable of receiving and responding to transactions from other QHINs for all Exchange Purposes, to ensure that health information can be exchanged among health information networks under TEFCA. For this same reason, we propose in § 172.201(b)(5) to require a QHIN to be capable of initiating transactions for the Exchange Purposes that such entity will permit its Participants and Subparticipants to use through TEFCA Exchange. Ensuring that QHINs will respond to Participant or Subparticipant requests for information, and that the Participants or Subparticipants are able to receive the information from QHINs, enables health information exchange among the QHINs, Participants and Subparticipants.</P>",
      "<P>A QHIN's ability to transact for all Exchange Purposes is a threshold requirement for an entity that seeks Designation and is essential for ensuring that the TEFCA framework facilitates exchange for each Exchange Purpose authorized in the Common Agreement or an SOP(s) for implementation. Without this requirement, there would be no certainty that the TEFCA framework would advance exchange beyond the Treatment Exchange Purpose, which is the most prevalent purpose for health information exchange today and the purpose of use that most health care entities seeking Designation would be most familiar with. TEFCA's network connectivity, including this requirement that QHINs have the ability to exchange for all Exchange Purposes, and scale would help, for example, health care providers gain access to more comprehensive and complete information about their patients, which can support improved care, better outcomes, decreased provider burden, and reduced costs.</P>",
      "<P>Entities performing TEFCA Exchange as described in § 172.201 will have the option to request information for all Exchange Purposes. At the time of publication of this Proposed Rule, TEFCA supports exchange for the following Exchange Purposes: treatment; payment; health care operations; public health; Individual Access Services (IAS), and government benefits determination. Over time, additional Exchange Purposes may be added. Information regarding whether responses are required for a given Exchange Purpose will be included in a TEFCA standard operating procedure.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(c), we propose that an Applicant QHIN must meet certain Designated Network Services requirements. Based on our experience in the health IT ecosystem, we believe adequate network performance is important for the success of TEFCA, as those participating in TEFCA Exchange would be most likely to trust the TEFCA infrastructure if it is performing at a high level. Unreliable network performance would dilute confidence in the network and discourage participation.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(c)(1), we propose that a QHIN must maintain the organizational infrastructure and legal authority to operate and govern its Designated Network. For instance, under this proposal, QHINs would be required to have a representative and participatory group or groups that approve the processes for fulfilling the TEFCA governance functions and that participate in governance for the Designated Network. In § 172.201(c)(2), we propose that a QHIN must maintain adequate written policies and procedures to support meaningful TEFCA Exchange as described in § 172.201 and fulfill all responsibilities of a QHIN in this part (which an entity agrees to by signing the Common Agreement). For instance, under this proposal, QHINs would be required to have a detailed written policy that describes the oversight and control of the technical framework that enables TEFCA Exchange.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(c)(3), we propose that a QHIN must maintain a Designated Network (as proposed to be defined in § 172.102) that can support a transaction volume that keeps pace with the demands of network users. Since TEFCA is a nationwide network and will be used daily to support various health data needs to inform care delivery, quality assessments, public health, and health care operations, QHINs must be capable of transacting high volumes of data reliably and at scale. In § 172.201(c)(4), we propose that a QHIN must maintain the capacity to support secure technical connectivity and data exchange with other QHINs. One of the most fundamental aspects of interoperable network exchange is technical connectivity, which makes network-to-network exchange possible and, therefore, is important to include in this regulation.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In §§ 172.201(c)(5)-(7), we propose certain requirements related to governance for TEFCA to ensure all QHINs are aligned and able to manage risk effectively. In § 172.201(c)(5), we propose that a QHIN must maintain an enforceable dispute resolution policy governing Participants in the Designated Network that permits Participants to reasonably, timely, and fairly adjudicate disputes that arise between each other, the QHIN, or other QHINs. This proposed requirement would afford flexibility to QHINs to establish their own dispute resolution process while ensuring the process is timely and fair. Disputes may arise for a variety of reasons, so the QHIN, as the entity overseeing its Participants, is best placed to handle such disputes in a way that minimizes disruptions for the rest of the network. Ensuring that a QHIN has such a dispute resolution policy would, therefore, likely minimize such disruptions. Similarly, in § 172.201(c)(6), we propose that a QHIN maintain an enforceable change management policy consistent with its responsibilities as a QHIN. A change management policy establishes the standard procedures to approve different types of changes to TEFCA documents (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         standard operating procedures) and policies and will help to avoid changes that are disruptive or in conflict across entities. In § 172.201(c)(7), we propose that a QHIN must maintain a representative and participatory group or groups with the \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63647\"/>\n                        authority to approve processes for governing the Designated Network. The participatory network governance built into the TEFCA infrastructure is important to ensure that the requisite engagement exists between QHINs, Participants, and Subparticipants participating in TEFCA Exchange. We believe the above requirements are fundamental aspects of a network-of-networks focused on participatory governance and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing health information exchange landscape.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Regarding the proposed requirement in § 172.201(c)(7) specifically, we emphasize that TEFCA uses a representative and participatory governance structure. Representative and participatory governance gives those participating in the network a role in informing the policies and decisions that ultimately would affect them. Such a governance structure helps to motivate health care entities and their networks to voluntarily join TEFCA. We believe that requiring a QHIN to have a representative and participatory group or groups that has the ability to review and provide input on the governance requirements of the QHIN's Designated Network is an optimal approach for this requirement.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(c)(8), we propose that an entity seeking to become a QHIN must maintain privacy and security policies that permit the QHIN to support TEFCA Exchange. These policies currently include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>",
      "<P>• Maintaining certification under a nationally recognized security framework by a qualified, independent third party that ensures its assessments are consistent with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) (using both NIST 800-171 (Rev. 2) and NIST 800-53 (Rev. 5) as a reference), that reviews the QHIN's HIPAA Security Rule risk analysis (consistent with § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)), and verifies all requirements for technical audits and assessments are met.</P>",
      "<P>• Having a qualified, independent third party complete an annual security assessment consistent with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) (using both NIST 800-171 (Rev. 2) and NIST 800-53 (Rev. 5) as a reference). The third party would review the QHIN for compliance with HIPAA Security Rule risk analysis requirements consistent with § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Additionally, the annual security assessment must include comprehensive internet-facing penetration testing, must include an internal network vulnerability assessment, and must use methodologies and security controls consistent with Recognized Security Practices, as defined by Public Law No: 116-321 (42 U.S.C. 17931 and 300jj-52).</P>",
      "<P>• Employing a Chief Information Security Officer with executive-level responsibility.</P>",
      "<P>• Disclosing any breaches of electronic protected health information (including disclosure of any such breaches within the three (3) years preceding applying to become a QHIN) to the RCE and to all QHINs that are likely impacted;</P>",
      "<P>• Complying with 45 CFR part 164, subparts A, C, and E, as applicable, as if the QHIN were a covered entity as described in that regulation; and</P>",
      "<P>• Maintaining and complying with a written privacy policy.</P>",
      "<P>These policies and requirements will provide privacy and security protections for the health information that will be exchanged through TEFCA. All entities that elect to participate in TEFCA, including entities not regulated under HIPAA, will be expected to meet a high bar for privacy and security given the nature of the data being exchanged. Further, the policies would advance TEFCA exchange by making it clear to those interested in participating that privacy and security measures are in place. It is unlikely that an entity would wish to participate in a network without privacy and security standards, thereby inhibiting TEFCA exchange.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        To further support the security of TEFCA, we propose in § 172.201(c)(9), that a QHIN must maintain data breach response and management policies that support secure TEFCA Exchange. For instance, given the number of electronic connections TEFCA will support, a data breach response and management policy would support a transparent process and timely awareness of a data breach or other security events (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         ransomware attacks) which could enable the QHIN to manage secure connectivity services without disrupting patient care. These proposed policies and requirements reflect the available privacy and security standards.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.201(c)(10), we propose that a QHIN must maintain adequate financial and personnel resources to support all its responsibilities as a QHIN, including, at a minimum, sufficient financial reserves or insurance-based cybersecurity coverage, or a combination of both. This requirement will help to provide stability to TEFCA in the event of unexpected financial or economic occurrences—whether system-wide or specific to individual QHINs.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        For instance, this requirement could be met if the QHIN has available a minimum amount of cash, cash equivalents, borrowing arrangements (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         a line of credit) or a mix of the three that is equal to six (6) calendar months of operating reserves. Regarding insurance requirements, a QHIN's general liability coverage and the cyber risk/technology coverage should each have limits of at least $2,000,000 per incident and $5,000,000 in the aggregate, which limits can be met through primary coverage, excess coverage, available internal funds, or a combination thereof. We note that the requirements proposed here may be insufficient for larger QHINs, and recognize that certain QHINs will meet and exceed these minimums.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>QHINs will be the central connection points for TEFCA Exchange, responsible for routing queries, responses, and messages among many participating entities and individuals. We propose, in § 172.201(c)(10), that QHINs must have sufficient financial resources and personnel capacity to perform such functions successfully. We also believe that QHINs must be prepared to address incidents should they arise and must have the ability to fulfill potential liability obligations, either through insurance, sufficient financial reserves, or some combination of the two.</P>",
      "<P>One goal of TEFCA is to support patients gathering their healthcare information. In § 172.202, “QHINS that offer individual access services,” we propose Individual Access Services (IAS) requirements for a QHIN to obtain and maintain Designation under TEFCA if that QHIN voluntarily offers IAS. In § 172.202(a), we propose that a QHIN would be required to obtain express consent from any individual before providing IAS, as defined in § 172.102. We believe this is an important requirement so that individuals who use IAS that a QHIN offers are informed of the privacy and security practices that are being employed to protect their data. In § 172.202(b), we propose that a QHIN would be required to make publicly available a privacy and security notice that meets minimum TEFCA privacy and security standards to support transparent exchange practices. We believe this requirement would provide transparency to all individuals who are considering using IAS regarding how their data is protected and secured by a QHIN providing IAS.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In § 172.202(c), we propose a QHIN that is the IAS provider for an individual, would be required to delete the individual's Individually Identifiable Information (as defined in § 172.102) maintained by the QHIN upon request by the individual except as prohibited by Applicable Law or where such information is contained in \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63648\"/>\n                        audit logs. We believe this requirement would provide individuals with reassurance that they control access to their data. We believe the carve out for audit logs is appropriate because audit logs are generally used to provide chronological records of system activities and should not be deleted. In § 172.202(d), we propose that a QHIN would be required to permit any individual to export in a computable format all of the individual's Individually Identifiable Information maintained by the QHIN as an IAS provider. We believe this requirement would ensure that individuals may access, control, and use their own data held by an IAS provider.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.202(e), we propose that all Individually Identifiable Information the QHIN maintains must satisfy certain criteria, including: (1) all Individually Identifiable Information must be encrypted; (2) without unreasonable delay and in no case later than sixty (60) calendar days following discovery of the unauthorized acquisition, access, Disclosure, or Use of Individually Identifiable Information, the QHIN must notify, in plain language, each individual whose Individually Identifiable Information has been or is reasonably believed to have been affected by unauthorized acquisition, access, Disclosure, or Use involving the QHIN; and (3) a QHIN must have an agreement with a qualified, independent third-party credential service provider and must verify, through the credential service provider, the identities of individuals seeking IAS prior to the individuals' first use of such services and upon expiration of their credentials. We note that to the extent the QHIN is already required by Applicable Law to notify an individual as described in proposed § 172.202(e)(2), we are not proposing that it be required to duplicate such a notification. Lastly, the proposed requirement in § 172.202(e)(3) would set a baseline for proving the identity of IAS users that are requesting data via TEFCA Exchange.</P>",
      "<P>In some ways, IAS providers—should we finalize these proposals in § 172.202—would meet requirements above and beyond what the HIPAA Rules require of covered entities or business associates, including providing individuals with the right to delete their data and a requirement to encrypt all Individually Identifiable Information, as we propose in § 172.202(c) and § 172.202(e)(1). Encryption is an industry standard practice to protect data, and we believe the requirement we propose in § 172.202(e)(1) would create strong security of data while not creating undue burden to implement. We believe these proposed requirements are important because IAS providers will not always be HIPAA covered entities or business associates. Establishing these IAS requirements would ensure that QHINs that are IAS providers will meet certain minimum privacy and security requirements to protect patient data while also advancing the goal of improving patients' ability to access their data.</P>",

      "<P>The first step in becoming a QHIN under TEFCA is submission of an application. In § 172.301, we propose to establish the information Applicant QHINs must submit in order to be Designated as a QHIN. We propose that an Applicant QHIN must submit: (1) a completed QHIN application; and (2) a signed copy of the Common Agreement. Regarding the first proposed requirement, in § 172.301(a), the application may be updated over time and the most recent version will be available on ONC's and the RCE's website. The application will specify what supporting documentation an Applicant QHIN must submit. We propose the second requirement in § 172.301(b) because the Applicant QHIN would sign the Common Agreement upon application, but the RCE would only countersign and create a binding agreement with the Applicant QHIN once the Applicant QHIN completes Onboarding and is Designated.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The next step to becoming a QHIN is application review. In § 172.302, we propose a process, with required timelines and allowable extensions, for ONC (or an RCE) to review applications. We propose in § 172.302(a) that, on receipt of an application, ONC (or an RCE) will review the application to determine if the Applicant QHIN has completed all parts of the application and provided the necessary supporting documentation. Further, we propose that, if the QHIN Application is not complete, ONC (or an RCE) will notify the applicant in writing of the missing \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63649\"/>\n                        information within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the application. Last, we propose that ONC (or an RCE) may extend this period by providing written notice to the Applicant QHIN. We note that “written notice” throughout part 172 would include notice provided by email to the points of contact the Applicant QHIN listed in their application.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We believe the above timeframe and allowable extensions would allow ONC (or an RCE) enough time to perform a thorough review of each application and ensure that ONC (or an RCE) is provided with the responses and supporting documentation needed to assess the merits of an application. We believe the 30-day review timeframe—along with the ability of ONC (or an RCE) to extend this period by providing written notice to the Applicant QHIN—strikes the right balance between moving an application forward as quickly as possible while still providing ONC (or an RCE) with enough time to conduct a review of the application to ensure it is complete and contains all the required material.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose in § 172.302(b) that once the QHIN application is complete, ONC (or an RCE) will review the application to determine whether the Applicant QHIN satisfies the requirements for Designation set forth in § 172.201, and, if the Applicant QHIN proposes to provide IAS, the requirements set forth in § 172.202. We propose this step to make clear that ONC (or an RCE) will review an application not only for completeness but also to determine if the qualifications are met. We also propose ONC (or an RCE) would complete its review within sixty (60) calendar days of providing the Applicant QHIN with written notice that its application is complete. We further propose that ONC (or an RCE) may extend this period by providing written notice to the Applicant QHIN. We believe that sixty (60) calendar days will \n                        <E T=\"03\">generally</E>\n                         be an adequate amount of time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive review of the substance of the application. However, we are cognizant that there may be complex applications that require additional time for review and have, therefore, proposed that ONC (or an RCE) may extend this period by providing written notice to the Applicant QHIN.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.302(c) that ONC (or an RCE) may contact the Applicant while the application is being reviewed to request additional information. ONC (or an RCE) will provide the timeframe for responding to its request and the manner to submit additional information, which may be extended on written notice to the Applicant QHIN. We believe this provision would be beneficial because the Applicant QHIN will need to provide detailed responses that may be complex and will vary among Applicant QHINs. We anticipate there will often need to be a discussion between ONC (or an RCE) and the Applicant QHIN to reach a resolution and shared understanding. This provision would provide for this vital communication between ONC (or an RCE) and the Applicant QHINs. We propose that an Applicant QHIN must respond to ONC (or an RCE) within the timeframe ONC (or an RCE) identifies because ONC (or an RCE) will be in the best position to understand the complexity of the question and estimate a reasonable amount of time for the Applicant QHIN to respond. That said, we understand that each application, as well as the questions associated with each application, will vary significantly on a case-by-case basis and, therefore, are proposing that ONC (or an RCE) may extend the timeframe by providing written notice to the Applicant QHIN. We believe this approach creates appropriate flexibility regarding timing of Applicant QHIN responses, while still leaving the discretion to decide the need for and length of such extensions.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.302(d) that failure to respond to a request within the proposed timeframe, or in the manner specified, is a basis for a QHIN Application to be deemed withdrawn, as set forth in § 172.305(c)). In such situations, we propose that ONC (or an RCE) would provide the Applicant QHIN with written notice that application has been deemed withdrawn. We believe this requirement is important to support an efficient application process and to ensure that Applicant QHINs respond to requests in a timely manner. We reiterate that under proposed § 172.302(c), as discussed above, the ONC (or an RCE) can extend the timeframe for responding to a request for information. An Applicant QHIN should request an extension if it does not believe it can meet the proposed response timeframe.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.302(e) that if, following submission of the application, any information submitted by the Applicant QHIN becomes untrue or materially changes, the Applicant QHIN must notify ONC (or an RCE), in the manner specified by ONC (or an RCE), of such changes in writing within five (5) business days of the submitted material becoming untrue or materially changing. This proposed requirement takes into consideration the possibility that, over the course of ONC's (or an RCE's) review of an application, an Applicant QHIN's circumstances or information provided with the Applicant QHIN's application may change. This provision would ensure that if such changes occur, the Applicant QHIN would promptly notify ONC (or an RCE) of such changes. We believe, based on ONC's experience with health IT implementation and coordination efforts, that five (5) business days is enough time for the Applicant QHIN to notify ONC (or an RCE) of the change(s).</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.303, we propose requirements related to QHIN approval and Onboarding. We propose in § 172.303(a) that an Applicant QHIN would have the burden of demonstrating its compliance with all qualifications for Designation in § 172.201, and, if the Applicant QHIN proposes to provide IAS, the qualifications in § 172.202. We propose in § 172.303(b) that if ONC (or an RCE) determines an Applicant QHIN meets the requirements for Designation set forth in § 172.201, and, if the Applicant QHIN proposes to provide IAS, the qualifications set forth in § 172.202, then ONC (or an RCE) will notify the Applicant QHIN in writing that it has approved its application, and the Applicant QHIN can proceed with Onboarding. These proposed requirements are important for ensuring that the Applicant QHIN is notified of its status and support the transparency and efficiency of the Onboarding process.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.303(c) that an approved Applicant QHIN would be required to submit a signed version of the Common Agreement within a timeframe set by ONC (or an RCE). This proposed provision is important in addition to § 172.301(b) (which would require an Applicant QHIN to submit a signed version of the Common Agreement when applying) to ensure that, if the Common Agreement changes between the time the QHIN applies and when it is approved, the QHIN will have signed the most recent version. We did not propose a specific timeframe for submission, and instead propose to allow ONC (or an RCE) to set the timeframe for each Applicant QHIN, since we believe each timeframe should be tailored to the needs of the Applicant QHIN and the complexity of each application.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        We propose in § 172.303(d) that an approved Applicant QHIN must complete the Onboarding process set forth by ONC (or an RCE), including any tests required by ONC (or an RCE) to ensure the Applicant QHIN's network can connect to those of other QHINs, within twelve (12) months of approval of the QHIN application, unless that \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63650\"/>\n                        time is extended in ONC's (or an RCE's) sole discretion by up to twelve (12) months. Based on ONC's experience with health IT implementation and discussions with the current RCE, we believe the proposed twelve (12) month timeframe is sufficient time for approved Applicant QHINs to complete the Onboarding process including any tests with QHINs and other Applicant QHINs. We believe that timeframe strikes an appropriate balance between the need to onboard QHINs promptly and the need to ensure that all QHINs can connect immediately and seamlessly once Designated. We note that during the Onboarding process, the Applicant QHIN would have regular check-ins with ONC (or an RCE) to monitor the progress on any outstanding requirements, to coordinate technical testing, and to address any issues that could put the Applicant QHIN in jeopardy of failing to meet the proposed Onboarding timeframe detailed above.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.304, we propose the specific procedural requirements for the Designation of QHINs. In § 172.304(a), we propose the process that would follow an Applicant QHIN's satisfaction of the Onboarding process requirements. We propose that once the Onboarding process requirements are satisfied, the Common Agreement would be countersigned and the Applicant QHIN would receive a written determination indicating that it had been provisionally Designated as a QHIN, along with a copy of the countersigned Common Agreement.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.304(b), we propose that within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving its written determination of provisional Designation, each QHIN would be required to demonstrate in a manner specified by ONC (or an RCE) that it has completed a successful transaction with all other in-production QHINs according to standards and procedures for TEFCA Exchange. This proposed provision is important because it would ensure that a Designated QHIN is able to exchange information with other QHINs, which is a core function of QHINs. We believe that the thirty (30)-day timeframe will afford a Designated QHIN ample time to move from testing to production. We also believe that the standards and procedures for such exchanges should remain flexible such that ONC (or an RCE) may update the requirements from time to time as appropriate.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.304(c) that if a QHIN is unable to complete the requirement in § 172.304(b), described above, within the thirty (30)-day period provided, the QHIN would be required to provide to ONC (or an RCE) with a written explanation as to why the QHIN is unable to complete the requirement within the allotted time and include a detailed plan and timeline for completion of the requirement. We propose that ONC (or an RCE) will then review and approve or reject the QHIN's plan, basing its decision on the reasonableness of the explanation based on the specific facts and circumstances, within five (5) business days of receipt. We propose that if the QHIN fails to provide ONC (or an RCE) its plan or ONC (or an RCE) rejects the QHIN's plan, ONC (or an RCE) will rescind its approval of the application, rescind the provisional QHIN Designation, and deny the application. We believe these proposals would provide QHINs with the appropriate flexibility to request an extension if the circumstances do not allow the QHIN to meet the timeline. We believe the proposed five (5)-business day timeframe would provide ONC (or an RCE) with enough time to review the request and reach a decision regarding the request based on the information provided. We propose that within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of the term of the plan, each QHIN must demonstrate in a manner specified by ONC (or an RCE) that it has completed a successful transaction with all other in-production QHINs according to standards and procedures for TEFCA Exchange. We believe that the thirty (30)-day timeframe will afford a Designated QHIN ample time to move from testing to production.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.304(d), we propose that a QHIN Designation will become final sixty (60) days after a Designated QHIN has submitted its documentation, in a manner specified by ONC (or an RCE), that it has completed a successful transaction with all other in-production QHINs. This proposal will allow ONC (or an RCE) to exercise its ability to review a Designation.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.305, we propose requirements related to withdrawal of an application. In § 172.305(a), we propose that an Applicant QHIN may withdraw its application by providing ONC (or an RCE) with written notice in a manner specified by ONC (or an RCE). In § 172.305(b), we propose that an Applicant QHIN may withdraw its application at any point prior to Designation. In § 172.305(c), we propose that on written notice to the Applicant QHIN, an application may be deemed as withdrawn as a result of the Applicant QHIN's failure to respond to requests for information from ONC (or an RCE). We believe the approach in proposed § 172.305 would create an efficient process for ONC (or an RCE) to deem applications withdrawn if an Applicant QHIN fails to respond to requests for information, and also supports a flexible process by allowing an Applicant QHIN, for whatever reason, to decide to withdraw its application without penalty. Given the requirements placed on Applicant QHINs seeking to be Designated, we think it is reasonable to believe that some Applicant QHINs will need to withdraw their applications to address any number of issues that could arise during the application process.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.306, we propose that if an Applicant QHIN's application is denied, the Applicant QHIN will be provided with written notice that includes the basis for the denial. We do not propose a specific template that would be used to explain the basis of a denial, as such explanation would likely vary based on the specific facts and circumstances.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.307, we propose requirements for re-application. In § 172.307(a), we propose that Applicant QHINs may resubmit their applications by complying with the provisions of § 172.301 in the event that an application was denied or withdrawn. We note that re-application pursuant to § 172.307(a) would also be conditioned on meeting the requirements of proposed paragraphs (b)-(d) of § 172.307, as applicable. We propose in § 172.307(b) that an Applicant QHIN may reapply at any time after it has voluntarily withdrawn its application as specified in § 172.305(a). We want to create flexibility for Applicant QHINs to reassess their applications and, if desired, resubmit the application. We also believe that providing an Applicant QHIN that withdraws its application with discretion to choose when to re-apply would result in better applications and create administrative efficiency. This is because Applicant QHINs would be motivated to self-identify issues and correct them in a subsequent application. Also, Applicant QHINs that withdraw applications early would allow ONC (or an RCE) to avoid expending resources to review and identify such issues.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In § 172.307(c), we propose that if ONC (or an RCE) deems an application to be withdrawn as a result of the Applicant QHIN's failure to respond to requests for information from ONC (or an RCE), then the Applicant QHIN may reapply by submitting a new application no sooner than six (6) months after the date on which its previous application was submitted. We propose that the Applicant QHIN must respond to the prior request for information and must include an explanation as to why no response was previously provided within the required timeframe. We propose in § 172.307(d) that if ONC (or \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63651\"/>\n                        an RCE) denies an application, the Applicant QHIN may reapply by submitting a new application consistent with the requirements in § 172.301, no sooner than six (6) months after the date shown on the written notice of denial. The application must specifically address the deficiencies that constituted the basis for denying the Applicant QHIN's previous application. We believe that six (6) months is an appropriate minimum time period for re-application because we would expect the Applicant QHIN to take such time to reconsider and address the deficiencies in its application. Our goal with such proposed requirements is that the Applicant QHIN will be thoughtful about its new application and will work to address the problems with its initial application.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We believe the proposed six (6)-month minimum time period before re-application, in § 172.307(c) and (d), would support efficiency in the review process, as ONC (or an RCE) could shift its attention to other Applicant QHINs or issues while the Applicant QHIN whose application was withdrawn as a result of the Applicant QHIN's failure to respond to requests for information or denied reconsiders its application and addresses the previously identified deficiency or deficiencies. These requirements would also support efficiency in the application process, as ONC (or an RCE) should only allocate resources to review a re-application if the Applicant QHIN has clearly addressed outstanding questions and previously identified deficiencies. On the other hand, we believe that if an Applicant QHIN withdraws its application, then the Applicant QHIN is best positioned to determine when it is ready to re-apply. Because the Applicant QHIN that withdraws its application has not had its application denied or deemed withdrawn for failure to respond to ONC (or an RCE) requests for information, the Applicant QHIN may be prepared to reapply much sooner than is the case for Applicant QHINs that have had their application denied or deemed withdrawn. We welcome comments on the proposed processes and requirements in this subpart. Specifically, we request comment on whether the six-month timeframe for re-application after an application has been deemed to be withdrawn as a result of the Applicant QHIN's failure to respond to requests for information or has been denied is appropriate, as well as other timeframes we propose.</P>"

      "<P>Within this subpart, we propose provisions associated with suspension, notice requirements for suspension, and the effect of suspension. In § 172.401, we propose provisions related to ONC (or the RCE) suspension of a QHIN or directed suspension of a Participant or Subparticipant. In § 172.401(a), we propose that ONC (or an RCE) may suspend a QHIN's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange if the ONC (or an RCE) determines that a QHIN is responsible for a Threat Condition. Within the TEFCA infrastructure, QHINs are expected to meet a high bar for security, including, but not limited to, third-party certification to industry-recognized cybersecurity standards; compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule or the standards required by the HIPAA Security Rule; annual security assessments; designation of a Chief Information Security Officer; and having cyber risk coverage.</P>",
      "<P>This proposed provision would support the overall security of TEFCA and align with the security requirements for QHINs by enabling ONC (or an RCE) to suspend a QHIN's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange if the QHIN is responsible for a Threat Condition. According to the definition proposed in § 172.102, a Threat Condition may occur in three circumstances: (i) a breach of a material provision of a Framework Agreement that has not been cured within fifteen (15) calendar days of receiving notice of the material breach (or such other period of time to which contracting parties have agreed), which notice shall include such specific information about the breach that is available at the time of the notice; or (ii) a TEFCA Security Incident, as that term is defined in § 172.102; or (iii) an event that ONC (or an RCE), a QHIN, its Participant, or their Subparticipant has reason to believe will disrupt normal TEFCA Exchange, either due to actual compromise of, or the need to mitigate demonstrated vulnerabilities in, systems or data of the QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant, as applicable; or through replication in the systems, networks, applications, or data of another QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant; or (iv) any event that could pose a risk to the interests of national security as directed by an agency of the United States government. We propose this policy because we believe that in each of these situations, in order to protect the security of TEFCA Exchange, ONC (or an RCE) must be able to take immediate action to suspend a QHIN's authority to engage in TEFCA exchange and limit the potential effects of the Threat Condition.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.401(b), we propose if ONC (or an RCE) determines that one of a QHIN's Participants or Subparticipants has done something or failed to do something that results in a Threat Condition, ONC (or an RCE) may direct the QHIN to suspend that Participant's or Subparticipant's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange. This provision proposes to extend the ONC (or an RCE's) authority to suspend a QHIN's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange to also include the authority to order a QHIN to suspend a Participant's or Subparticipant's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange. We believe this provision would help protect the security of TEFCA Exchange because any Threat Condition—whether due to the action or inaction by a QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant—could jeopardize the security of TEFCA and must be addressed once identified. We believe that in order to protect the security of TEFCA Exchange, ONC (or an RCE) must be able to take immediate action to order a QHIN to suspend a Participant's or Subparticipant's authority to engage in TEFCA Exchange and limit the potential effects of a Threat Condition resulting from something a Participant or Subparticipant has done or failed to do.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        In § 172.401(c), we propose that ONC (or an RCE) will make a reasonable effort to notify a QHIN in writing, in advance, of ONC's (or an RCE's) intent to suspend the QHIN or to direct the QHIN to suspend one of the QHIN's Participants or Subparticipants, and give the QHIN an opportunity to respond. Such notice would identify the Threat Condition giving rise to such suspension. We acknowledge that a suspension would significantly disrupt the activities of a QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant and therefore § 172.401(c) proposes to require ONC (or an RCE) to make a reasonable effort to notify affected parties in advance of the ONC's (or an RCE's) intent to suspend. We propose to only require ONC (or an RCE) to make a reasonable effort to notify the entity because the circumstances surrounding a Threat Condition may limit ONC's (or an RCE's) ability to provide advance written notice to the QHIN or the QHIN's Participants or Subparticipants, despite ONC's (or an RCE's) best efforts. In § 172.401(d), we propose ONC (or an RCE) shall lift a suspension once the Threat Condition is resolved. We believe that it would no longer be necessary to continue a suspension once a Threat Condition is resolved.\n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63652\"/>\n                    </P>",
      "<P>We believe the provisions outlined in § 172.401 would help maintain the integrity of TEFCA and offer a transparent approach to suspension that would communicate the reason for suspension, require timely notification of suspension, and afford QHINs an opportunity to resolve the issue(s), including in concert with their Participants or Subparticipants, that led to the suspension and resume TEFCA Exchange.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.402, we propose provisions related to selective suspension of TEFCA Exchange between QHINs. In § 172.402(a), we propose that a QHIN may, in good faith and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, suspend TEFCA Exchange with another QHIN because of reasonable concerns related to the privacy and security of information that is exchanged. In § 172.402(b), we propose that if a QHIN decides to suspend TEFCA exchange with another QHIN, it is required to promptly notify, in writing, ONC (or an RCE) and the QHIN with which it is suspending exchange of its determination and the reason(s) for making the decision.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        These proposed provisions are intended to further strengthen the privacy and security protections within TEFCA by extending suspension rights to QHINs to suspend exchange with another QHIN due to reasonable concerns related to the privacy and security of information that is exchanged. We emphasize that we are proposing that the concerns must be “reasonable” \n                        <E T=\"03\">and</E>\n                         must be related to the “privacy and security of information that is exchanged” in order to ensure that suspension of TEFCA Exchange between QHINs is not based on other factors, such as competitive advantage. We solicit comments on examples of reasonable concerns related to the privacy and security of information that is exchanged. These proposed requirements would support trust between QHINs, which is a foundational element of TEFCA and would help TEFCA establish a universal floor for interoperability across the country. We believe prompt notification of the selective suspension to ONC (or an RCE) and the suspended QHIN would enable all parties involved to be aware of the situation in a timely fashion and take action to maintain the privacy and security of TEFCA Exchange activities.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.402(c), we propose that if a QHIN suspends TEFCA Exchange with another QHIN under § 172.402(a), it must, within thirty (30) calendar days, initiate the TEFCA dispute resolution process in order to resolve the issues that led to the decision to suspend, or the QHIN may end its suspension and resume TEFCA Exchange with the other QHIN within thirty (30) calendar days of suspending TEFCA Exchange with the QHIN. We propose this provision to provide the parties with an opportunity to resolve concerns related to privacy and security and potentially continue exchange once the issues have been resolved. We believe the thirty (30)-day timeframe would provide sufficient time to resolve issues that led to the suspension, end the suspension, and resume TEFCA Exchange activities in a timely manner. Ultimately, TEFCA will be most impactful and successful if QHINs trust each other and are able to confidently exchange information with each other, so it is in the best interests of the QHINs involved, as well as TEFCA overall, to address and resolve a selective suspension quickly, and by the least disruptive means possible.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.402(d), we propose that, provided that a QHIN suspends TEFCA exchange with another QHIN in accordance with other provisions in § 172.402 and in accordance with Applicable Law, such selective suspension would not be deemed a violation of the Common Agreement. This provision would promote the integrity of TEFCA by ensuring that a QHIN with reasonable and legitimate concerns related to the privacy and security of information that is exchanged would not be deterred from suspending exchange activities with another QHIN for fear of being in violation of the Common Agreement.</P>",

      "<P>In this subpart, we propose provisions related to a QHIN's right to terminate its own Designation, ONC's (or an RCE's) obligation to terminate a QHIN's Designation and related notice requirements, and requirements related to the effect of termination. In § 172.501, we propose that a QHIN may terminate its own QHIN Designation at any time without cause by providing ninety (90) calendar days prior written notice. This provision supports the voluntary nature of TEFCA by allowing a QHIN that, for whatever reason, no longer wants to serve as a QHIN, to terminate its own QHIN Designation with ninety (90) business days prior written notice. We believe a QHIN should be able to terminate its Designation, regardless of the circumstances or reason and that ninety (90) business days would provide enough time for ONC, the RCE and the departing QHIN to analyze and address the impacts of the QHIN's departure.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.502, we propose that a QHIN's Designation will be terminated with immediate effect by ONC (or an RCE) giving written notice of termination to the QHIN if the QHIN: (a) fails to comply with any regulations of this part and fails to remedy such material breach within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving written notice of such failure; provided, however, that if a QHIN is diligently working to remedy its breach at the end of this thirty (30) day period, then ONC (or an RCE) must provide the QHIN with up to another thirty (30) calendar days to remedy its material breach; or (b) a QHIN breaches a material provision of the Common Agreement where such breach is not capable of remedy. We request comments on examples of material provisions of the Common Agreement where a breach is not capable of remedy.</P>",
      "<P>We believe these proposals would promote transparency in TEFCA and strengthen the underlying trust among and between entities connected to TEFCA. These termination provisions would enable ONC (or an RCE) to take swift action to remove a non-complaint QHIN and ensure that entities that fail to meet their obligations as QHINs (by failing to comply with the regulations of this Part or by breaching a material provision of the Common Agreement) are no longer able to act as QHINs under the TEFCA framework. Without the ability for ONC (or an RCE) to terminate non-compliant QHINs, this trust—which is foundational to TEFCA and necessary for the ultimate success of TEFCA—could quickly erode and undermine TEFCA's progress.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.503, we propose that QHINs and ONC (or an RCE) would be able to terminate the QHIN's Designation at any time and for any reason by mutual, written agreement. Allowing two parties to terminate an agreement by mutual, written agreement ensures that two parties are not forced to follow an agreement that neither wants to follow. ONC believes it is reasonable and efficient to allow termination at any time where both ONC (or an RCE) and the QHIN are satisfied that a QHIN's termination is in the best interest of all.</P>",

      "<P>\n                        In § 172.603, we propose the method and timing for filing an appeal.

With regard to an appeal of a termination, the fifteen (15) calendar day timeframe may be extended by ONC up to another fifteen (15) calendar days if the QHIN has been granted an extension for completing its remedy under § 172.502(a). The notice of appeal would serve to notify ONC that the Applicant QHIN or QHIN is planning to file an appeal and would require inclusion of only the minimum amount of information necessary to provide such notice (\n                        <E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>\n                         the date of the notice of appeal, the date of the decision being appealed, the Applicant QHIN or QHIN who is appealing, and what is being appealed).

      "<P>In § 172.603(c), we propose that an Applicant QHIN or QHIN filing the appeal may not submit on appeal any evidence it did not submit prior to the appeal, except by permission of the hearing officer. We believe this provision balances a QHIN or Applicant QHIN's right to introduce evidence with the need for orderly proceedings. We are aware that under our proposed regulations, QHINs facing suspension or termination do not have an express right to introduce evidence. We solicit comments on whether and when a QHIN facing suspension or termination should have a right to introduce that evidence—for example as part of demonstrating that a material breach has been remedied or is capable of remedy under § 172.502, at the hearing officer stage, or some combination of the two based on circumstances of the suspension or termination.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.604, we propose that an appeal would not stay a suspension or termination, unless otherwise ordered by ONC or the hearing officer assigned under § 172.605(b). This means that in the event of an appeal of a suspension or termination, the appeal would not stop the suspension or termination from being effective. We believe this proposed approach is important because a QHIN would only be suspended or terminated for infractions that could, for example, jeopardize the privacy and security of TEFCA Exchange.</P>",
      "<P>Before a QHIN is terminated under § 172.502(a), the QHIN would have already been given an opportunity to remedy the breach unless the breach is not capable of remedy. The move by ONC or and RCE to terminate a QHIN would mean either the QHIN tried and failed to remedy the issue, or a remedy is not possible. In either case, we believe it would be appropriate not to stay the termination. In the case of a suspension, the QHIN would have been found to be responsible for a Threat Condition, and we believe the risk to the privacy and security of the TEFCA ecosystem would far outweigh any perceived benefit of staying the suspension.</P>",

In § 172.605(b), we propose if ONC declines review under subsection (a), or if ONC made the determination under review, ONC would arrange for assignment of the case to a hearing officer to adjudicate the appeal.\n                    </P>",

Given the gravity and potentially significant implications (financial, effect on existing contracts, etc.) of a denied application, suspension, or termination, we believe the hearing officer assigned by the National Coordinator should make an independent decision, taking all of the facts and evidence the parties present into consideration.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        The “preponderance of the evidence” standard means the burden of proof is met when the party with the burden (the appealing Applicant QHIN or QHIN) convinces the fact finder (hearing officer) that there is a greater than 50% chance that the claim is true. This standard is used in most civil cases and would only require the appealing party to show that a particular fact or event was more likely than not to have occurred. We believe this threshold creates the right balance for requiring an appealing Applicant QHIN or QHIN to make a strong case to succeed on appeal, while not imposing a standard that would be extremely difficult for the appeal Applicant QHIN or QHIN to meet. We request comment on whether the “preponderance of the evidence” is the appropriate standard, or if another standard (\n                        <E T=\"03\">e.g.,</E>\n                         clear and convincing evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, etc.) would be more suitable.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>In § 172.606(b), we propose that a hearing officer would make a determination based on the written record or any information from a hearing conducted in-person, via telephone, or otherwise (for example, via video teleconference). We propose that the written record would include ONC's or the RCE's determination and supporting information, as well as all appeal materials submitted by the Applicant QHIN or QHIN pursuant to § 172.603. We propose these requirements for the written record because it is important that the written record reflect both the position of ONC or the RCE and the Applicant QHIN or QHIN. We propose that the hearing officer would have sole discretion to conduct a hearing in certain situations. We propose that the hearing officer could conduct a hearing to require either party to clarify the written record under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Last, we propose that the hearing officer could conduct a hearing if they otherwise determine a hearing is necessary. We believe the last provision is necessary because it gives the hearing officer discretion to conduct a hearing based on the specific circumstances surrounding the appeal, even if the need for the hearing does not fit under the first or second criteria detailed above.</P>",

We believe this provision will help ensure that the appeals process is consistent and fair for all involved.</P>",
      "<P>In § 172.607, we propose requirements related to a decision by the hearing officer. In § 172.607(a), we propose that the hearing officer would issue a written determination.

      "<P>To ensure accountability, and to ensure that the hearing officer's decisions would be subject to the discretionary review of a principal officer of the United States, we propose in § 172.607(b) that a hearing officer's decision on an appeal is the final decision of HHS unless within 10 business days, the Secretary, at the Secretary's sole discretion, chooses to review the determination. We also propose that ONC would notify the appealing party if the Secretary chooses to review the determination and once the Secretary makes his or her determination. This provision would also align § 172.607 procedures with the ONC Health IT Certification Program appeals procedures in § 170.580(g) as we propose to revise them in this Proposed Rule (see Section III.D.2.b of this preamble). We have not proposed a specific timeframe for the Secretary to complete their review (if the Secretary chooses to review) because we believe that if the Secretary makes the decision to review a hearing officer's determination, the Secretary would be informed enough on the issues of the case to determine an appropriate review timeframe.</P>",

      "<P>We propose in § 172.700 that subpart G would establish the attestation submission requirements applicable to QHINs. In § 172.701, we propose attestation submission requirements for QHINs and review and acceptance processes that ONC will follow for TEFCA attestations. In § 172.701(b), we propose that in order to be listed in the QHIN Directory described in proposed § 172.702, a QHIN would be required to submit to ONC an attestation affirming agreement with and adherence to the Trusted Exchange Framework and its adoption of the Common Agreement. We further propose in § 172.701(b) that a QHIN would be required to submit to ONC identifying information consisting of its name, address, city, State, zip code, and a hyperlink to its website. We also propose that the QHIN would be required to submit to ONC identifying information about its authorized representative including the representative's name, title, phone number, and email address. We propose that a QHIN would also be required to provide documentation confirming its Designation as a QHIN. We also propose that a QHIN would be required to provide ONC with written notice of any changes to its identifying information provided in accordance with § 172.701 within 30 calendar days of the change(s) to its identifying information. We believe the above provisions provide clear instructions for submitting a QHIN attestation that will support a consistent and transparent QHIN attestation process and provides ONC with the information needed to identify the entity and contact the authorized representative.</P>",

We propose in § 172.701(d) that once a QHIN has submitted its attestation and documentation, ONC would either accept or reject the submission within 30 calendar days. We propose that ONC would accept the submission if it determines that the QHIN has satisfied the requirements of §§ 172.701(b) and (c). In such instances, we propose that ONC would provide written notice to the applicable QHIN's authorized representative that the submission has been accepted. In § 172.701(d), we also propose that ONC would reject a submission if it determines that the requirements of § 172.701(b), § 172.701(c), or both, have not been satisfied. In such instances, we propose that ONC would provide written notice to the QHIN's authorized representative of the determination along with the basis for the determination. We propose that an ONC determination would be a final agency action and not subject to administrative review, except the Secretary may choose to review the determination as provided in § 172.607(b). However, we propose that a QHIN may, at any time, resubmit an attestation and documentation in accordance with §§ 172.701(b) and (c). We believe these submission procedures will support a consistent and transparent QHIN attestation process. We welcome comments on these procedures.</P>",

      "<P>We propose § 172.702(b)(2) to identify within the QHIN directory those QHINs that have been suspended under the Common Agreement. A QHIN directory that includes QHINs that have adopted the Common Agreement and are capable of TEFCA Exchange and those QHINs suspended under the Common Agreement offers a transparent list of QHINs participating in TEFCA. As noted above, the QHIN directory may serve as a useful tool for the public, Federal partners, and other interested parties seeking information about QHINs. Therefore, we welcome comments regarding the information we propose to include in the QHIN directory.</P>",
      "<P>We propose in § 172.702(c) to establish requirements for removal of a QHIN from the QHIN directory. We propose in § 172.702(c)(1) that ONC will remove a QHIN that is no longer eligible for QHIN status from the QHIN directory. We propose that a QHIN whose Common Agreement has been terminated would no longer be considered a QHIN and so would be removed from the QHIN directory. The removal of a QHIN whose Common Agreement has been terminated from the QHIN Directory would be a ministerial action by ONC.</P>",

Under § 172.702(c)(3), we propose that the written statement would include, as appropriate, (i) the name of the terminated QHIN and the name and contact information of the authorized representative of the QHIN; (ii) a short statement setting forth findings of fact with respect to any violation of the Common Agreement or other basis for the QHIN's termination; (iii) other materials as the RCE may deem relevant.

In accordance with Executive Order 12866, we have included the RIA summary table as Table 80. The impact analysis primarily assesses the costs and benefits of proposed changes to the Program. The Program, as described elsewhere in this \n                        <PRTPAGE P=\"63663\"/>\n                        rule, is voluntary. Developers who present their technology for certification do so for varied reasons, including so their users can meet Federal requirements and to demonstrate conformance with federally adopted standards. However, we recognize there are real costs associated with any changes to certified health IT and requirements for developers of certified health IT to maintain certification. We estimate these costs to the best of our ability, examining the development tasks and burden associated with each proposal. We also estimate and articulate the expected benefits of these proposals. Whereas we estimate the costs associated with development tasks for developers of certified health IT, benefits can be more far reaching—affecting developers directly through standards harmonization and clear processes for technology development as well as health care providers, patients, and payers who are end-users of the technology and whose use derives direct benefit through improvements to electronic health information exchange, access to electronic health information, and automation of clinical and administrative processes. Although participation in the Program is voluntary, we believe that requirements to use certified health IT by Federal programs, to adopt health IT standards, and exchange and make data available to health care providers, patients, and payers provide levers to technology developers to present their IT for certification. Program requirements are meant to harmonize health IT development and promote interoperability through common health IT standards and rules of information exchange and access. The benefits described more thoroughly, below, such as those for interoperability, as we have described in prior rulemaking, such as the ONC Cures Final Rule (85 FR 25642), are derived from more universal adoption of these standards and rules that enable data to be electronically recorded, stored, exchanged, and accessed more harmoniously. These actions may remove artificial barriers to information exchange and access that often result in the duplication of diagnostic and laboratory testing, fragmented care, missing medical record information, and less consumer choice in the healthcare market.\n                        <E T=\"51\">263 264</E>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                    </P>",

We also, where applicable, carry forward cost estimates from prior rulemakings to be consistent in time and effort estimates. Novel cost estimates also use a mix of subject matter expertise and appropriate proxies to quantify costs. We note these methods and sources in the tables. We recognize that the costs developers incur as a result of these policies may be passed on to certified health IT end-users.

      "<P>However, we are clear in our analysis and estimates of costs, below, that we do not assess the costs on health care providers to use this technology. This may include changes to how the provider electronically documents information in the medical record, changes to workflow, or how technology is implemented by a provider and at a particular health care delivery site. The costs estimate the expected burden on health IT developers to develop and provide the revised technology to their users, not the expected burden on users to use the revised technology, which is considered out of scope for this rulemaking, as we do not require the use of the technology, just the development of the technology. Other Federal agencies do require, as of their official rulemaking and policymaking, the use of certified health IT to participate in programs or receive payment for treating a patient. The costs and benefits of these requirements on health care providers to adopt and use certified health IT are estimated and explained in those rules' regulatory impact analysis. For example, the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization final rule (89 FR 8758) describes how the implementation of electronic, standards-based prior authorization and other information exchange integrated into the EHR can reduce burden on patients, providers, and payers resulting in an estimated $15 billion of savings over ten years. The proposals described below will help establish and build these standards and other technology into certified health IT for use by health care providers and others to achieve these estimated savings.</P>",
      "<P>The benefits, both quantifiable and not quantifiable, articulated in this impact analysis have the potential to remove barriers to interoperability and EHI exchange for all these health care providers. Though these policies first require effort by developers of certified health IT to reflect them in their software, they must then be implemented by end-users to achieve the stated benefits—to improve healthcare delivery and the overall efficacy of the technology to document, transmit, and integrate EHI across multiple data systems.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        To this end, we acknowledge that these estimated costs may not be borne solely by the developers of certified health IT and could be passed on to end-users through health IT developers' licensing, maintenance, and other operating fees and costs. We assume health IT developers may pass on up to the estimated costs of these policies, but not amounts above those estimated totals. We request comment on the increase in software licensing costs and other fees resulting from these proposals and if ongoing licensing costs and fees already consider the costs of meeting new regulations and certification requirements (\n                        <E T=\"03\">i.e.,</E>\n                         some or none of the estimated costs of this proposed rulemaking would be passed on to technology end-users.)\n                    </P>",
      "<P>\n                        However, we have limited data on the fees and costs charged by health IT developers and how those fees and costs are distributed across various customer organizations. Given the ongoing nature of updates made by ONC to the Program, EHR developers may have already built in the costs associated with making these updates in their existing contracts. To the extent the costs associated with the updates have not been taken into account, these costs may be passed on to end-users in different ways by developers of certified health IT and across different health care provider organization types.

      "<P>What we can say with more certainty is the overall impact of these policies on the healthcare system as a whole. These policies affect the certified technology used by the providers who give care to a vast majority of Americans. Nearly all emergency room visits, hospital stays, and regular check-ups are documented and managed using certified health IT. These policies affect the interoperability of EHI for these care events and patients' electronic access to their health information. Certified health IT is now a nearly ubiquitous part of U.S. healthcare, and the costs and benefits estimated here encompass the widespread use of these technologies and their impact on all facets of care.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        Overall, it is highly speculative to quantify benefits associated with the new technical requirements and standards for certification criteria we have proposed in this proposed rule. Emerging technologies may be used in ways not originally predicted. For example, ONC helped support the development of SMART on FHIR®, which defines a process for an application to securely request access to data, and then receive and use that data. ONC could not have predicted the scale this technical approach has already achieved. Not only is it used to support major EHR products, but is also leveraged, for example, by numerous digital health and technology companies to connect and integrate with EHRs to provide healthcare and other services to app and digital services users.\n                        <SU>267</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         It is also speculative to quantify benefits for specific stakeholders because benefits associated with many of ONC's policies, which advance interoperability, do not necessarily accrue to stakeholders making the investments in developing and implementing the technologies. Benefits related to interoperability are spread across the healthcare ecosystem and can be considered a societal benefit. We have sought to describe benefits for each of the specific policies, and we welcome comments on how to quantify these benefits across a variety of stakeholders.\n                    </P>",

Participation in the Program is voluntary and participants face a mix of incentives to test and certify their products. Some health IT developers participate to ensure their users, who must meet Federal requirements or receive incentives to adopt and use certified health IT, have certified technology that meets the most current requirements. Some others, like new entrants, certify to demonstrate conformance and adoption of specific standards and functionalities, despite not having a large user base.

We can assume a hospital will face different costs than a physician practice, and no two hospitals will face the same costs, as those costs may vary based upon various characteristics, including but not limited to: staff size, patient volume, and ownership. The same is true for individual clinical practices, for which costs may vary across the same characteristics as hospitals. However, given our limited data, our approach to model pass-through costs onto health care providers assumes that hospitals face the same average costs and that they face a higher average cost per site than an individual clinical practice.

Table 5 shows an assumed distribution of the costs across technology users. The cost to any one hospital or practice is small compared to the cost as a whole. The average hospital user of certified health IT could be expected to face up to $69,203 on average additional costs associated with implementing technology that adopt these policies. The average clinician practice site could be expected to face up to $2,250 on average additional costs associated with implementing technology that adopt these policies. These are considered pass-through costs incurred by the health IT developer to adopt these policies and not additional costs exogenous to health IT developer efforts to adopt and engineer these policies into their certified health IT. To the extent that the increase in prices is large, the pass-through of costs onto consumers might decrease the quantity of care demanded.

If adopted, newer versions of minimum standards code sets would serve as the baseline for certification and developers of certified health IT would be able to use newer versions of these adopted standards on a voluntary basis.

Furthermore, making diagnostic imaging results electronically available to patients through their online medical records may further enable patient-mediated exchange with other health care providers. Patients would be able to access the imaging results online, download the images to their personal device, and securely transmit the results to their provider from their online medical record.

Then we propose placing the encryption standard and default settings requirements, that we propose should apply to both the end-user device and server encryption requirements, into § 170.315(d)(7)(iii) and (iv) respectively.

      "<P>\n                        The proposed updates are expected to have a wide range of benefits for end-users of health IT. Currently, health care providers rely on manual and duplicative data entry processes to report live births into State vital records programs. With most U.S. births occur at birthing facilities or in hospital settings, birth reporting typically entails clinicians supplying the medical and health information for the birth certificate to a State web-based Electronic Birth Registration System (EBRS). Typically, non-clinical hospital staff collect the legal and demographic information from the mother through a standardized worksheet, which is then entered into the State EBRS by hospital staff. This information is then sent to the State and a birth certificate is then issued by the State vital records authority. Most of the data necessary to report a live birth is also dually entered into EHRs by providers. As a result, birth reporting processes are duplicative and burdensome for providers and hospital systems. Adopting a standards-based approach to birth reporting would facilitate interoperability between the various systems involved in birth reporting, eliminate duplication of effort associated with entering information into multiple systems, and reduce burden of reporting for providers and hospital systems.

One systematic review found that PDMP use influences health care providers' clinical decision-making in relation to the supply of controlled substances, refusal to prescribe or treat, risk mitigation strategies, communication, education and counselling, referrals and care coordination, and stigma.\n                        <SU>403</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         PDMP use has also been shown to be associated with several benefits including reductions in opioid prescribing rates, opioid-related inpatient stays, and opioid-related emergency department visits as well as better care coordination for patients and informed clinical decision-making.\n                        <E T=\"51\">404 405 406</E>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         PDMP supports which allow for integration and the interoperability of PDMP data can support advancement of patient-centered care that focuses on the specific needs, and safety, of the individual. For example, the viewing of opioid therapies and nonopioid therapies together supports the 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids, Recommendation 1: “Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy.” \n                        <SU>407</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         The CDC recommends that PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. Universal application of PDMP queries would mitigate bias and therefore the recommendation is that clinicians should query the PDMP when feasible for all patients rather than differentially based on assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients. EHR integration of PDMP data would increase feasibility of universal application.\n                    </P>",

Adoption of Bulk FHIR group export, including support of the _ since parameter, as well as support for the _ type query parameter is already well underway, and the _ since parameter is even better clarified in the v2 IG. In the same 2020 study, researchers surveyed various companies (including payers, EHR and cloud vendors, research organizations, and developers) implementing SMART/HL7 FHIR Bulk Data to assess the state of the API's implementation.\n                        <SU>429</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         18 of 19 survey respondents noted that they had implemented (5) or were making progress towards implementing (13) the group export functionality. 17 of 19 respondents indicated that their organization had “implemented” or had “in progress” the Bulk filter “_ type” parameter. Only a slightly smaller portion (16 of 19) had indicated that they had implemented or were in progress of implementing the Bulk filter “_ since” parameter. As of 2020 Q2, organizations were already making substantial progress towards adoption, so these additional requirements for certification and testing are not expected to be unusually burdensome.

Major concerns expressed included processing time for data export, choosing breakpoints to divide large data files, granular access to specified FHIR resources, and opportunities for reducing the costs to host data. We believe that these concerns are addressed in the contents of this proposal.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The primary additional functionality offered through server support for the “group-export” “OperationDefinition” is filtering by date with the “_ since” parameter.

As data are updated, FHIR resources modified within a particular timeframe can be exported, preventing the need to repeatedly export a full dataset when data is being followed and repeatedly shared over time. In addition to preventing the recipient of the data from needing to spend valuable time resources sifting through data to identify data of particular interest (based on the specified timeframe) and delete duplicate data that may have already been received through a previous export, limitations on the amount of data exported through use of the _ since parameter can prevent exports from taking up valuable storage on a user's machine when unnecessary data is otherwise included. We expect the same benefit from adoption of the _ type parameter.\n                    </P>",
      "<P>Furthermore, we believe our proposals offer opportunities for increased efficiency in these spaces, specifically in contexts where Bulk FHIR group export functionalities are used. Use of the _ since and _ type parameters for group export of FHIR resources is anticipated to lead to improvements in API performance because it allows for a more specified group of resources to be exported, thus limiting the time required for export and improving efficiency. Server support of the _ type parameter for querying in preparation for group export is further expected to have benefits for privacy and security, as specifying FHIR resource types for export limits the risk of exporting sensitive or confidential data, thereby preventing inadvertent harm to patients through exposure of private data. Therefore, these proposals pose an opportunity to address needs indicated in the aforementioned survey.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        The group export requirement is anticipated to meet existing needs across Bulk FHIR use cases with respect to limiting the quantity of data exported through additional specification. In one study assessing the feasibility of using of Bulk FHIR queries to get COVID-19 vaccination registry information to public health workers performing patient follow-up after vaccines and to schedule vaccination appointments, the researchers found that the specifications in the current Bulk FHIR standard for patient data export was clunky and not scalable for public health purposes, which in the context of using data to facilitate response to the COVID-19 pandemic would have typically required the export of records for thousands of individuals.\n                        <SU>430</SU>\n                        <FTREF/>\n                         Because of this, these researchers found the need to utilize an optional group extension that allowed the specification of particular patient groups for data export. This demonstrates a use case with a practical need for expansion of the standard through adoption of the Bulk v2 IG, and therefore also server support for the “group-export” “OperationDefinition”.\n                    </P>",

The proposed update would revise our MFA certification criterion by replacing our current “yes” or “no” attestation requirement with a specific requirement to support multi-factor authentication and configuration for three certification criteria: “view, download, transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1)); “standardized API for patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) (for “patient facing” access); and “electronic prescribing” (§ 170.315(b)(3)). We believe these updates match industry best practices for information security, particularly for important authentication use cases in health IT. Finally, we propose to remove references to § 170.315(d)(13) in § 170.550(h)(3) for all certification criteria except for § 170.315(e)(1), (g)(10), and (b)(3).</P>",

These results do not confirm our priors, when ONC finalized the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, that most, if not nearly all developers and products, would support MFA. The proposed revision requires most of the developers who must comply with the current adopted certification criterion with actual MFA functionality versus an attestation of its use.</P>",
      "<P>The proposed revised certification criterion will require developers who certify “view, download, transmit to 3rd party” (§ 170.315(e)(1)); “standardized API for patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) (for “patient facing” access); and “electronic prescribing” (§ 170.315(b)(3)) to comply with the revised certification criterion.

Tables 69 and 70 shows the estimated labor costs per product to modify the “multi-factor authentication” (MFA) certification criterion in § 170.315(d)(13). We recognize that health IT developer costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume all health IT developers will incur the costs noted in Table 71.</P>",
      "<P>2. We estimate that 323 products certified by 252 developers will be affected by our proposal. These estimates are a subset of the total estimated health IT developers and certified products we estimated above.</P>",
      "<P>The estimate of 323 products certified by 252 developers is derived as follows. We estimate that, in total, 387 health IT developers will certify 521 health IT products impacted by this rulemaking.

As of the end of 2022, 96% of developers and 96% of products certified § 170.315(d)(13). The proposed modification to the certification criterion revises the certification criteria that must comply with this certification criterion to § 170.315(e)(1), § 170.315(g)(10), and § 170.315(b)(3) alone. As of the end of 2022, 65% of developers and 62% of products certified § 170.315(e)(1), § 170.315(g)(10), or § 170.315(b)(3).

Therefore, assuming 323 products overall and a labor rate of $127.82 per hour, we estimate that the total cost to all health IT developers would, on average, range from $0 to $11.8 million. This would be a one-time cost to developers per product that is certified to the specified certification criterion and would not be perpetual.</P>",
      "<P>The proposed updates will improve information security and access. We believe our proposal helps improve security by increasing support of MFA. This is because it is unlikely that an unauthorized individual or entity will be able to succeed in proving one's identity when more than one authentication factor is used. The MFA certification criterion, as adopted through the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, required an attestation to promote transparency and encourage health IT developers who were not using MFA to do so. In that rule we articulated expected benefits that adopting MFA would reduce the likelihood that authentication credentials would be compromised and would eliminate an unnecessary use of IT resources and could directly reduce providers' operating/support costs, which would reduce their administrative and financial burden.</P>",
      "<P>\n                        At the time, we believed supporting MFA to be an established best practice among industry developers, including health IT developers, but we did not have access to published literature that detailed how health IT developers were already supporting MFA industry-wide, but we believed the majority of health IT developers, or around 80%, were taking such actions. We assumed that building this functionality was in the future project plans for the remaining 20% because, as noted previously, adopting these capabilities is an industry best practice.

As a result, it is difficult to locate empirical data related to many of these health IT developers to correlate to the SBA size standard. However, although not perfectly correlated to the size standard for NAICS code 541511, we do have information indicating that over 60% of health IT developers that have had Complete EHRs and/or Health IT Modules certified to the 2011 Edition have less than 51 employees.</P>",
